<p class="abstract">Abstract</p>
In times of crisis such as the COVID-19 pandemic, citizens need to stay
informed about recent political events. To this end, people increasingly
use social media. However, because social media are particularly
engaging, many find it hard to disconnect, especially during times of
crisis. In this preregistered study, I investigate whether using social
media for COVID-19 related reasons affects psychological well-being.
Using data from the Austrian Corona Panel Project consisting of 3,485
participants from 34 waves, this research question was analyzed using
random effects within between models, controlling for several stable and
varying confounders. The results showed that COVID-19 related social
media use did not meaningfully reduce well-being. Other factors such as
health, income, exercise, or internal locus of control showed larger and
meaningful effects.

<div id="introduction" class="section level1">
<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>Amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, staying informed became paramount,
prompting heavy reliance on social media for updates, with use being at
an all time high <span class="citation">(Statista, 2021)</span>. The
phenomenon of “doomscrolling” emerged as individuals struggled to
disengage from COVID-19-related news <span class="citation">(Buchanan et
al., 2021; Sharma et al., 2022)</span>, sparking concerns about its
impact on mental health <span class="citation">(Sandstrom et al.,
2021)</span>. While initial research began exploring this question <span
class="citation">(e.g., Bendau et al., 2021; Eden et al., 2020; Sewall
et al., 2021)</span>, the impact of COVID-19 related social media use on
well-being remains largely unknown. This study aims to assess the
effects of different social media usage patterns on individual
well-being using a comprehensive longitudinal dataset spanning 34 waves,
offering insights into within-person causal relationships.</p>
<!-- During the COVID-19 pandemic it was critical to stay informed regarding the latest developments. -->
<!-- How dangerous is the virus?  -->
<!-- In what region is it spreading?  -->
<!-- How is it transmitted?  -->
<!-- What are the current safety regulations? -->
<!-- To obtain relevant information, many people heavily relied on social media, with use being at an all time high [@statistaAverageDailyTime2021]. -->
<!-- Some actually could not stop using social media to learn about COVID-19 related news, and a new phenomenon termed "doomscrolling" emerged [@sharmaDarkEndTunnel2022]. -->
<!-- Many users were glued to their screens and found it hard to pursue other relevant activities [@buchananBriefExposureSocial2021]. -->
<!-- In the media it was hence increasingly asked whether using social media for COVID-19 related reasons would, next to all other stressors, create an additional burden on mental health [@sandstromDoomscrollingCOVIDNews2021]. -->
<!-- Although research has begun addressing this question -->
<!-- [e.g., @bendauAssociationsCOVID19Related2021; @edenMediaCopingCOVID192020; @sewallObjectivelyMeasuredDigital2021], -->
<!-- it still largely unknown if COVID-19 related social media use during the pandemic has had a meaningful impact on well-being. -->
<!-- This study hence aims to 1) reveal the effect of the different types and channels of social media use on individual well-being, 2) provide generalizable and robust results by analyzing a large-scale longitudinal data-set with 34 waves, and 3) determine the within-person causal effects by analyzing how changes in social media use lead to changes in well-being. -->
<div id="understanding-well-being-and-media-use" class="section level2">
<h2>Understanding Well-being and Media Use</h2>
<p>This study investigates how different <em>facets</em> of subjective
well-being are affected by different <em>types</em> and different
<em>channels</em> of communication <span class="citation">(Meier &amp;
Reinecke, 2020)</span>. Building on the typology of subjective
well-being—defined as “referring to the various types of subjective
evaluations of one’s life, including both cognitive evaluations and
affective feelings” <span class="citation">(Diener et al., 2018, p.
3)</span>—three different well-being facets are analyzed: life
satisfaction, positive affect, and negative affect.</p>
<p>Social media is a broad term, encompassing subdimensions such as
social networking sites (e.g., Facebook or Instagram), instant
messengers (e.g., WhatsApp or Signal), or interactive video-platforms
(e.g., YouTube or TikTok) <span class="citation">(Carr &amp; Hayes,
2015)</span>. Effects of social media depend on how they are used: while
purposeful, active, social use is generally related to positive
outcomes, passive, non-purposeful and asocial use is related to negative
outcomes <span class="citation">(Frison &amp; Eggermont, 2015; Verduyn
et al., 2022)</span>. However, note that these general distinctions have
been challenged recently <span class="citation">Valkenburg et al.
(2022)</span>. In this study, I hence distinguish three types of use and
five popular channels. The types of use include posting (active use),
reading (passive use), and liking and sharing (low-threshold active use)
COVID-19 related content.
<!-- In doing so, this study analyzes social media use focused on COVID-19 related content. -->
<!-- , which includes posting thoughts about the pandemic, reading posts and comments , or liking and sharing COVID-19 related content. -->
The five channels to be investigated are Facebook, Twitter, Instagram,
WhatsApp, and YouTube, which at the time ranked among the most popular
social media services in Austria.</p>
<p>This study aims to provide a nuanced analysis of how a specific type
of social media use influences various well-being outcomes. A general
measure of time spent on social media would be insufficient to address
how engagement with COVID-19-related content affects users. Conversely,
using overly specific measures might be less broadly relevant or
insightful. For example, demonstrating that receiving uplifting messages
boosts social support or that encountering hate speech causes distress
might yield limited insights. That said, ultimately, the specificity of
a measure is not inherently right or wrong but reflects different
approaches to answering different questions.</p>
</div>
<div id="social-media-effects-on-well-being" class="section level2">
<h2>Social Media Effects on Well-Being</h2>
<!-- How easily can well-being be affected by external influences? -->
<!-- In general, according to the set-point theory, well-being is considered to be surprisingly stable [@lykkenHappinessWhatStudies1999]. -->
<!-- Although specific events such as marriage or salary increase can have significant impacts on well-being, effects are often only short-term, with well-being after some time returning to prior levels [@dienerAdvancesOpenQuestions2018]. -->
<!-- Specific factors such as unemployment, disability, or death, however, can cause long-term changes in well-being [@lucasAdaptationSetpointModel2007]. -->
<!-- So although well-being can be affected by external events and factors, it seems this does not happen easily. -->
<!-- Can social media use be such a factor? -->
<p>Current literature overviews suggest that more active social media
users report on average lower well-being <span class="citation">(Meier
&amp; Reinecke, 2020)</span>. However, for most well-being outcomes,
such as life satisfaction, general well-being, or loneliness, the
effects are small <span class="citation">(Meier &amp; Reinecke,
2020)</span>. In addition, these results are based mostly on
correlational research, and a recent meta study based on experimental
studies did not find significant causal effects <span
class="citation">(Ferguson, 2024)</span>. These small or even
non-existent findings can be explained with the differential
susceptibility of media effects model <span class="citation">(Valkenburg
&amp; Peter, 2013)</span>, which states that there is substantial
<em>variation</em> of media effects for individual users.
<!-- Whereas for some users social media are more beneficial, for others they are more harmful. -->
<!-- On average, however, effects tend to be small [@valkenburgDifferentialSusceptibilityMedia2013]. -->
For example, in one study it was estimated that roughly one quarter of
all users experienced negative effects, another quarter positive
effects, while for the rest the effects were neutral <span
class="citation">(Beyens et al., 2021)</span>.
<!-- Whether or not effects are positive or negative depend on (a) dispositional factors (e.g., personality, temperament, gender), (b) developmental factors (e.g., age, developmental tasks), (c) and social factors (e.g., environment, norms, upbringing) [@valkenburgDifferentialSusceptibilityMedia2013]. -->
<!-- Effects depend also on the content that is consumed---if the content is aligned with dispositions, developmental capacities, and converging contexts, effects tend to be stronger [@valkenburgDifferentialSusceptibilityMedia2013]. --></p>
<p>Why are the effects of social media use on well-being small on
average, especially given that several scholars theorize strong negative
effects <span class="citation">Twenge (2017)</span>? Two prominent media
effect theories argue implicitly against strong average negative
effects. First, according to mood management theory <span
class="citation">(Zillmann, 1988)</span>, using media can affect
people’s moods.
<!-- Use can be stimulating or overwhelming, relaxing or boring. -->
After some time, users implicitly learn which media help them balance
their mood and affect according to their own situational needs <span
class="citation">(Zillmann, 1988)</span>. Those media that eventually
become part of one’s media repertoire hence, on average, tend to be
beneficial for users to regulate their mood <span
class="citation">(Marciano et al., 2022)</span>. In conclusion, if a
certain medium is used frequently, mood-management theory argues that it
is likely not detrimental for well-being.</p>
<p>Second, while mood management theory considers media use mainly
driven by implicit learning experiences, uses and gratifications theory
upholds that the process is more explicit and rational <span
class="citation">(Katz et al., 1973)</span>. Users select those media
that they expect to have a desired effect, for example on mood,
knowledge, or entertainment.
<!-- If those beneficial media effects are missing, people will spend their time elsewhere. -->
And social media, in general, offer several beneficial effects,
explaining their ubiquitous use. They help find relevant information,
maintain and foster relationships, express one’s personality, and
entertain oneself <span class="citation">(Pelletier et al.,
2020)</span>.</p>
<p>Third, and closely related, media use affords both both positive and
negative mechanisms, which differently impact well-being outcomes. These
include factors like social comparison, inspiration, social
connectedness, social support, displacement of in-person activities,
information management, information overload, misinformation, reputation
building, romantic connection, coping resources, or emotional contagion
<span class="citation">(Clark et al., 2018; Hall &amp; Liu, 2022;
Pelletier et al., 2020; Vanden Abeele, 2021; Verduyn et al.,
2022)</span>. Given these differential mechanisms, strong one-sided
effects appear less likely than nuanced and moderate effects.</p>
<!-- In conclusion, because people spend so much time on social media consuming COVID-19 related content, according to mood management theory, uses and gratifications theory, and multiple differential mechanisms, average effects on well-being are likely not particularly negative. -->
</div>
<div id="social-media-during-covid-19" class="section level2">
<h2>Social Media During COVID-19</h2>
<p>If we look at COVID-19 related use more specifically, how could the
various types and channels of COVID-19 related social media use affect
well-being? Several uses and gratifications exist, which help explain
why people used social media frequently during the pandemic. Despite
incorrect information, social media provide a vast platform for
disseminating <em>accurate and timely information</em> about COVID-19
<span class="citation">(John Hopkins University, 2023)</span>.
<!-- Access to reliable information can help people make informed decisions, alleviate uncertainties, and feel empowered during the pandemic. -->
Social media platforms enable individuals to <em>connect with
others</em> who are experiencing similar challenges during the pandemic
<span class="citation">(Guazzini et al., 2022)</span>.
<!-- Engaging in online communities and support groups can provide emotional support and create a network of like-minded individuals. -->
Many mental health organizations and professionals utilize social media
to share tips, strategies, and resources for <em>maintaining mental
well-being</em> during the pandemic.
<!-- Engaging with such content might help individuals prioritize their mental health and develop resilience during challenging times. -->
Social media campaigns and initiatives can promote <em>positive COVID-19
behaviors</em>, such as mask-wearing, physical distancing, hand hygiene,
and vaccination <span class="citation">(Hunt et al., 2022)</span>, which
ultimately benefit well-being.
<!-- Public health organizations and influencers leverage the power of social media to spread awareness and encourage responsible actions, contributing to public health efforts and fostering a sense of collective responsibility. --></p>
<p>On the other hand, the effects might be negative, perhaps best
explained by the following five mechanisms. Social media platforms can
easily spread <em>false or misleading information</em> about COVID-19
<span class="citation">(Li et al., 2020)</span>.
<!-- Due to the ease of sharing and the lack of fact-checking, inaccurate information can go viral and might cause confusion, anxiety, and panic among users. -->
Constant exposure to COVID-19-related content on social media can lead
to <em>information overload</em> and contribute to heightened anxiety
levels <span class="citation">(Fan &amp; Smith, 2021)</span>.
<!-- The rapid spread of news, updates, and opinions can be overwhelming and might exacerbate existing stress or fears about the pandemic [@sharmaDarkEndTunnel2022]. -->
Discussions around COVID-19 are known for fostering negativity, with
users sometimes engaging in <em>cyberbullying and harassment</em>.
<!-- Discussions around COVID-19 can become heated and polarized, leading to personal attacks and online conflicts.  -->
<!-- Such experiences threaten mental well-being and might contribute to feelings of distress and isolation. -->
Social media often showcase the highlights and accomplishments of
others, encouraging <em>social comparison</em> <span
class="citation">(Przybylski et al., 2013)</span>. Especially during a
pandemic, seeing how others successfully cope with every-day
challenges—for example, by baking banana bread, inventing creative games
with kids, or exercising at home—might intensify feelings of inadequacy
or FOMO, especially when individuals are unable to participate in
similar activities due to restrictions or personal circumstances <span
class="citation">(Sharma et al., 2022)</span>.</p>
<!-- There is still limited empirical research on how well-being is affected by social media use that is focused on COVID-19 specifically. -->
<p>Echoing the theoretical rationales outlines above, empirical studies
have yielded mixed results. Some studies found negative effects,
indicating that excessive social media use for COVID-19 content led to
compulsive behavior and increased stress levels, particularly due to
upward social comparison <span class="citation">(Stainback et al.,
2020)</span>. Individuals who relied on social media as their primary
information source reported higher levels of anxiety and depression
symptoms <span class="citation">(Bendau et al., 2021)</span>.
Doom-scrolling was associated with negative emotional experiences <span
class="citation">(Buchanan et al., 2021)</span>. On the other hand, some
studies reported positive outcomes. Certain individuals experienced
increased virtual community and social connectedness during the pandemic
through social media, which contributed to their well-being <span
class="citation">(Guazzini et al., 2022)</span>. Additionally,
identification with social media networks was associated with reduced
feelings of loneliness <span class="citation">(Latikka et al.,
2022)</span>. Several studies reported mostly neutral or dual effects of
social media use on well-being indicators <span class="citation">(Eden
et al., 2020; Sewall et al., 2021)</span>.
<!-- Overall, the literature demonstrates a mixed picture, highlighting both positive and negative effects of social media use focused on or during COVID-19 on well-being. --></p>
<!-- It is important to consider individual differences, usage patterns, and other factors that may influence the impact of social media on well-being during this challenging period. -->
<p>In conclusion, given these mixed empirical results, together with the
observation that social media effects on well-being are very small in
general, and that several plausible theoretical mechanisms exist for
both positive and negative effects, I expect that COVID-19 related
communication on social media should not be decidedly positive or
negative.
<!-- It seems most likely that both positive and negative coexist, but that on average using social media for COVID-19 related reasons should not have substantial effects on well-being. --></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hypothesis: The within-person effects of all measures of COVID-19
related social media use (types: reading, liking and sharing, posting;
channels: Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, YouTube, WhatsApp) on all
measures of well-being indicators (positive affect, negative affect,
life satisfaction)—while controlling for several stable and varying
covariates such as sociodemographic variables and psychological
dispositions (see below)—will be trivial.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div id="smallest-effect-size-of-interest" class="section level2">
<h2>Smallest Effect Size of Interest</h2>
<p>Exploring the hypothesis entails establishing the criteria for
discerning a ‘trivial effect size.’ To achieve this, it is necessary to
define the smallest effect size of interest (SESOI) <span
class="citation">(Anvari &amp; Lakens, 2021)</span>.
<!-- , which helps determine an effect's practical significance.  --> In
this context, a trivial effect should fall below the threshold set by
the SESOI (detailed below). Determining what constitutes a minimally
intriguing, nontrivial effect is a matter with normative implications,
making it challenging to arrive at a definitive, singular consensus.
<!-- Nonetheless, it remains both essential and beneficial to strive for a reasonable benchmark.  -->
I propose the following SESOI as a suitable reference point for this
study:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>SESOI: If a heavy user of COVID-19 related social media content
suddenly <em>stops</em> using social media altogether, this should have
a <em>noticeable</em> impact on their overall well-being.</p>
</blockquote>
<!-- What does this mean practically and how can it be operationalized? -->
<p>Put concretely, in this study COVID-19 related social media use was
measured on a 5-point scale, ranging from 1 = <em>never</em> to 5 =
<em>several times a day</em>. Thus, a change of four units in social
media use (e.g., a complete stop) should correspond to a noticeable
change in well-being. According to <span class="citation">Norman et al.
(2003)</span>, people can reliably notice seven levels of change in
satisfaction with health. So if satisfaction is measured on a 7-point
scale, a four unit change in social media use should result in a one
unit change in life satisfaction. Life satisfaction was measured on an
11-point scale, and affect on a 5-point scale. Transposed to this
scaling, the SESOI for life satisfaction is <em>b</em> = ±.30, and for
positive and negative affect <em>b</em> = ±.15 (see online supplementary
material).</p>

<div id="sample" class="section level2">
<h2>Sample</h2>
<p>The data come from the Austrian Corona Panel Project <span
class="citation">(Kittel et al., 2020)</span>, which is a large-scale
standalone panel study, consisting of 34 waves.
<!-- The data are hosted on AUSSDA, are publicly available here (https://doi.org/10.11587/28KQNS). -->
<!-- Participants were sampled from a pre-existing online access panel provided by the company Marketagent, Austria. -->
<!-- Panel members were incentivized with 180 credit points for each wave of the study. -->
The study was conducted between March 2020 and February 2023. Between
March 2020 and July 2020, the intervals between waves were weekly, until
May 2022 (wave 32) monthly, and afterward after 5 months. Each wave
consists of at least 1,500 respondents. Panel mortality (on average ca.
5 percent per wave) was compensated through a continuous re-acquisition
of new participants (on average ca. 80 new respondents per wave). The
sample size was <em>N</em> = 3,641, with overall 123,794
observations.</p>
<!-- For an overview of the study set-up, see Figure \@ref(fig:study-desc). -->

<!-- ``` -->
<p>Achieved via quota sampling, the sample matched the Austrian
population in terms of age, gender, region/state, municipality size, and
educational level. In order to participate in the study, the respondents
needed to be Austrian residents and had to be at least 14 years of age.
All respondents needed to have access to the internet (via computer or
mobile devices such as smartphones or tablets). The average age was 40
years, 49 percent were male, 14 percent had a University degree, and 5
percent were currently unemployed.</p>

<h2>Data Analysis</h2>
<p>The hypothesis is analyzed using the interval testing approach as
proposed by <span class="citation">Dienes (2014)</span>. To illustrate,
let us consider the case of life satisfaction [SESOI: ±.30]. Here, the
null-region lies between -.30 and +.30.
<!-- If the 95% confidence interval falls completely within the null-region (e.g., _b_ = -.05, [95% CI: -.15, .05]), the hypothesis that the effect is trivial is supported. -->
If the confidence interval falls completely outside of the null-region
(e.g., <em>b</em> = -.40, [95% CI: -.45, -.35]), the hypothesis is
rejected and the existence of a meaningful negative effect is supported.
<!-- If the confidence interval and the null region overlap (e.g., _b_ = -.30, [95% CI: -.35, -.25]), the hypothesis is not supported and the results are considered inconclusive, while a meaningful positive effect is rejected. -->
<!-- If the confidence interval exceeds both sides of the null region (e.g., _b_ = -.025, [95% CI: -.40, .35]), the hypothesis is not supported and judgement is suspended. -->
For an illustration, see Figure @ref(fig:sesoi).</p>

<div id="causality" class="section level3">
<h3>Causality</h3>
<!-- When analyzing causality through longitudinal designs, it is important to address several critical aspects.  -->
<p>Analyzing causal effects within non-experimental designs requires
adopting an internal perspective, focusing on <em>within-person
effects</em> <span class="citation">(Hamaker, 2014)</span>. This entails
evaluating how alterations in an individual’s media consumption directly
impact changes in their own well-being.
<!-- Comparisons between individuals, as observed in longitudinal data, lack the granularity needed to understand these causal dynamics [@hamakerWhyResearchersShould2014].  -->
Consequently, this study exclusively investigates within-person effects.
<!-- to shed light on this intricate relationship. --></p>
<p>An essential strategy for isolating the genuine impact of variables
is to <em>control for confounding factors</em> that influence both media
use and well-being <span class="citation">(Rohrer, 2018)</span>. In the
context of within-person analysis, this necessitates accounting for
time-varying confounders <span class="citation">(Rohrer &amp; Murayama,
2023)</span>. However, a cautious balance must be maintained by not
controlling for variables that mediate the relationship <span
class="citation">(Rohrer, 2018)</span>, as their inclusion could distort
the assessment of the causal effect. This study therefore incorporated
several control variables (see below), which have demonstrated
connections with both social media use and well-being and are likely not
mediators <span class="citation">(Eger &amp; Maridal, 2015)</span>.
<!-- These encompass gender, age, education, place of birth and parental place of birth in Austria, Vienna residency, consumption of text-based and video-based news, household characteristics, health status, living space features, employment-related factors, income, outdoor activities, risk propensity, and locus of control.  --></p>
<p>Establishing causality necessitates determining a <em>plausible
temporal interval</em> <span class="citation">(Rohrer &amp; Murayama,
2023)</span>. For instance, fluctuations in positive and negative affect
call for shorter intervals, while the more enduring nature of life
satisfaction implies longer intervals <span class="citation">(Dienlin
&amp; Johannes, 2020)</span>. In this study, I examine the linkage
between changes in social media use and changes in affect within the
same week. Specifically, I investigate if heightened COVID-19-related
social media use during a week corresponds with enhanced or diminished
affect during that same week. I consider a longer interval for life
satisfaction, examining whether increased COVID-19-related social media
use over the course of a week influences one’s life satisfaction at the
week’s end.
<!-- This approach aims to uncover whether changes in social media consumption prompt simultaneous changes in affect and subsequent changes in life satisfaction. -->
<!-- Furthermore, the study's main analyses implement this temporal interval through item wording rather than relying on lagged measures from previous waves.  -->
Supplementary analyses extend this investigation to observe how media
use might affect well-being one or four months later.
<!-- In all instances, confounding variables are methodically controlled for, enhancing the study's capacity for causal interpretation. --></p>
</div>
<div id="statistical-model" class="section level3">
<h3>Statistical model</h3>
<p>The hypothesis was analyzed using random effect within-between models
<span class="citation">(REWB, Bell et al., 2019)</span>. Altogether
three models were run, one for each dependent variable. The data were
hierarchical, and responses were separately nested in participants and
waves (i.e., participants and waves were implemented as random effects).
Nesting in participants accounts for the within-person design. Nesting
in waves controls for general exogenous developments, such as general
decreases in well-being in the population, for example due to lockdown
measures.
<!-- To illustrate, if general levels of well-being were reduced at one wave, for example due to lockdowns, this was accounted for in the model. -->
Thus, there was no need additionally to control for specific phases or
measures of the lockdown. Predictors were modeled as fixed effects. They
included social media communication types and channels, separated into
within and between-person factors, as well as stable and varying
covariates.
<!-- Between-person predictors are the predictors centered on the grand mean; within-person predictors are the predictors centered on the person's mean. -->
Between-person predictors (which, measuring relations, are not of
particular interest in this study, but are reported online) represent
how the mean of one respondent differs from the mean of all the other
respondents. The within-person predictors represent how much a person at
one specific wave differs from their own mean.
<!-- For example, we could find that on Wave 3 a person used social media more than usual, while also experiencing more negative affect than usual. -->
All predictors were included simultaneously in each of the three models.
No collinearity of predictors was observed.</p>
<p>The factorial validity of the scales were tested with confirmatory
factor analyses (CFA). Because Mardia’s test showed that the assumption
of multivariate normality was violated, I used the more robust
Satorra-Bentler scaled and mean-adjusted test statistic (MLM) as
estimator. Mean scores were used for positive and negative affect.
Although imputation has inherent drawbacks, we followed recent
recommendations to impute missing data on larger scales <span
class="citation">(Enders, 2022)</span>. Missing responses were imputed
using multiple imputation with predictive mean matching (five
iterations, 30 data-sets), including categorical variables. All
variables were imputed except the social media use measures, as they
were not collected on each wave. All variables included in the analyses
presented here were used to impute missing data. For the main analyses,
results were pooled across all thirty data-sets.</p>
<p>To contextualize the results, I conducted additional exploratory
analyses (see online materials) I reran the analyses (a) with additional
not-preregistered covariates such as trust in media or government, (b)
without covariates, (c) with single imputation, and (d) without
imputation.

<p>To capture positive affect, respondents were asked how often in the

<div id="covid-19-related-social-media-use" class="section level3">
<h3>COVID-19 related social media use</h3>
<p>COVID-19 related social media use focused on communication types was
measured with the three dimensions of (a) reading, (b) liking and
sharing, and (c) posting. The items come from <span
class="citation">Wagner et al. (2018)</span> and were adapted for the
context of this study. The general introductory question was “How often
during the last week have you engaged in the following activities on
social media?”. The three items were “Reading the posts of others with
content on the Coronavirus”, “When seeing posts on the Coronavirus, I
clicked ‘like’, ‘share’ or ‘retweet’”, “I myself wrote posts on the
Coronavirus on social media.” Answer options were 1 (<em>several times
per day</em>), 2 (<em>daily</em>), 3 (<em>several times per week</em>),
4 (<em>weekly</em>), 5 (<em>never</em>). The items were inverted for the
analyses.</p>
<p>COVID-19 related social media use focused on channels was measured
with five variables from <span class="citation">Wagner et al.
(2018)</span>, adapted for this study. The general introductory question
was “How often in the last week have you followed information related to
the Corona-crisis on the following social media?” The five items were
(a) Facebook, (b) Twitter, (c) Instagram, (d) Youtube, and (e) WhatsApp.
Again, the answer options were 1 (<em>several times per day</em>), 2
(<em>daily</em>), 3 (<em>several times per week</em>), 4
(<em>weekly</em>), 5 (<em>never</em>). Again, the items were inverted
for the analyses.</p>
<p>Social media use was measured for all participants on waves 1, 2, 8,
17, 23, and 28 (see Figure 1). Freshly recruited respondents always
answered all questions on COVID 19-related social media use. Because new
respondents always provided data on media use, it was possible to
include these data into the analyses. Hence, for the main analyses data
from all 34 waves were used.
<!-- In the additional analyses I tested longer intervals, namely if changes in social media use were associated with changes in well-being either one month of four months later. -->

<h3>Control variables</h3>
<p>The effects of COVID-19 related social media use were controlled for
the following stable variables: gender (female, male, diverse), age,
education (ten options), Austria country of birth (yes/no), Austria
parents’ country of birth (no parent, one parent, both parents), and
household size. I also controlled for the following varying covariates:
five items on current living conditions, including self-reported
physical health, whether participants contracted COVID-19 since the last
wave, current household income, working in home-office, and overall work
hours; nine items measuring use of specific national text-based and

<h2>Descriptive Analyses</h2>
<p>Looking at the variables from a descriptive perspective, aligned with
set-point theory we can see that the level of all well-being measures
were comparatively stable during data collection (see Figure
@ref(fig:fig-descriptives)). COVID-19 related social media use, however,
showed changes. Reading, sharing and liking COVID-19 related content
decreased substantially (almost one scale point from 3 to 2). Posting
about COVID-19 related content stayed the same. Using Facebook and
WhatsApp for COVID-19 related content decreased. Instagram, YouTube, and
Twitter stayed the same. The general initial decrease could be explained
by the fact that the collection of data began at the end of March 2020,
hence approximately three months after the pandemic’s onset. After an
initial uptick, COVID-19 related social media use might have already
been declining at the time.</p>

</div>
<p>Using the average values across all waves, which provides a stable
picture of the general relations, I next looked at the correlations
between social media use and well-being (see Figure
@ref(fig:fig-correlations)).
<!-- Several interesting patterns emerged. --> In general, people who
spend more time engaging with COVID-19 related content on social media
reported reduced well-being. Users who spend more time reading, liking
and sharing, and posting COVID-19 related content were less satisfied
with their lives. They also showed slightly less positive affect. This
overall negative picture was even more pronounced for negative affect.
People who engaged more with COVID-19 related content, including all
types and channels of communication, reported substantially higher
levels of negative affect. For example, people who were more likely to
post COVID-19 content had much higher levels of negative affect
(<em>r</em> = .61). Note that these results represent between-person
correlations, not causal within-person effects.</p>

<h2>Preregistered Analyses</h2>
<!-- The study's main hypothesis was that the causal effects of all types and channels of social media use on all facets of well-being would be trivial. -->
<p>Regarding the effects of different <em>communication types</em>
(i.e., reading, sharing, of posting about COVID-19 related content), all
within-person effects fell completely within the a-priori defined null
region (see Figure @ref(fig:fig-within)). For example, respondents who
used social media more frequently than usual to like or share COVID-19
related content did not show a simultaneous change in life satisfaction
(<em>b</em> = -0.02 [95% CI -0.06, 0.01]). As a result, the hypothesis
of trivial effects was supported for all COVID-19 related types of
social media communication.</p>
<p>However, several effects stood out, as statistically they were
significantly different from zero. Users who read more COVID-19 related
content than usual reported slightly reduced levels of positive affect
(<em>b</em> = -0.03 [95% CI -0.05, -0.02]). Users who liked and shared
more COVID-19 related content than usual also experienced slightly more
negative affect than usual (<em>b</em> = 0.05 [95% CI 0.04, 0.07]).
Posting COVID-19 related content affected all types of well-being. Users
who wrote more COVID-19 related posts than usual also reported slightly
less life satisfaction than usual (<em>b</em> = -0.04 [95% CI -0.08,
-0.01]) and slightly more negative affect than usual (<em>b</em> = 0.05
[95% CI 0.04, 0.07]). Interestingly, however, users who wrote more
COVID-19 related posts than usual also experienced slightly
<em>higher</em> levels of positive affect than usual (<em>b</em> = 0.02
[95% CI 0.01, 0.04]).</p>
<p>Regarding the COVID-19 related use of <em>social media channels</em>
(i.e., Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, YouTube, and Twitter) the results
were comparable (see Figure @ref(fig:fig-within)). Changes in the
frequency of using different social media channels to attain information
regarding COVID-19 were unrelated to meaningful changes in well-being.
For example, respondents who used Facebook more frequently than usual to
learn about COVID-19 did not show a simultaneous change in life
satisfaction (<em>b</em> -0.01 [95% CI -0.04, 0.02]). In sum, the
hypothesis of trivial effects was supported also for the COVID-19
related use of important social media channels.</p>
<p>That said, two effects differed statistically from zero. Respondents
who used Twitter more frequently than usual to attain COVID-19 related
content reported slightly higher levels of negative affect than usual
(<em>b</em> = 0.02 [95% CI 0.01, 0.04]). Likewise, respondents who used
YouTube more frequently than usual for COVID-19 related issues reported
slightly higher levels of negative affect than usual (<em>b</em> = 0.01
[95% CI &lt; 0.01, 0.02]). However, both effects were still completely
inside of the null region, hence likely not large enough to be
considered meaningful.</p>
<p>For an overview of all within-person effects, see Figure
@ref(fig:fig-within).</p>
<div class="figure">

<div id="exploratory-analyses" class="section level2">
<h2>Exploratory Analyses</h2>
<p>To contextualize the results reported above and to see if the study
included any meaningful effects at all, I also looked at the effect
sizes of the covariates.
<!-- Because each variable featured different response options, which would require defining a SESOI for each variable, I hence report the results of the standardized scales, which allows for a better comparison across the differently scaled variables. -->
I report the results of the standardized scales, which allows for a
better comparison across the differently scaled variables. As a SESOI,
we can build on Cohen’s convention that small effects begin at
<em>r</em> = |.10|.</p>
<p>The results showed that several effects crossed or fell completely
outside of the SESOI, and can hence be considered meaningful. For
example, if physical health decreased, this had a meaningful detrimental
impact on life satisfaction (<span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span>
= .19 [95% CI .18, .20]), positive affect (<span
class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> = .18 [95% CI .17, .19]), and
negative affect (<span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> = -.19 [95%
CI -.20, -.18]). Spending more time outside to exercise meaningfully
increased positive affect (<span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> =
.12 [95% CI .11, .14]). The strongest aspect affecting well-being was
internal locus of control. If people felt more in control of their
lives, this strongly increased both life satisfaction (<span
class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> = .33 [95% CI .31, .35]) and
positive affect (<span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> = .28 [95%
CI .27, .30]), while decreasing negative affect (<span
class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> = -.29 [95% CI -.31, -.27]). For an
overview, see Figure @ref(fig:fig-control).</p>

<p class="caption">

</div>
<p>Because life satisfaction is more stable than affect, the effects of
communication might materialize some time later. I hence also tested the
effects across the longer intervals of one month and four months.
Results showed that all effects disappeared. No effect remained
significant, implying that at least in this case in this case effects
take place on a shorter interval.</p>
<p>Finally, as suggested by the differential susceptibility of media
effects model, media effects can depend on dispositional factors,
developmental stages, or cultural norms <span
class="citation">(Valkenburg &amp; Peter, 2013)</span>, such as gender
and age <span class="citation">(Orben et al., 2022)</span>. I hence
reran the analyses, differentiating effects for boys and girls and for
age cohorts. The results showed that effects did not differ across
genders. The effects also did not depend on age. However, one effect
stood out and was significant. Compared to the middle age category
Generation X, results showed that if users from Generation Z posted more
COVID-19 content than usual this lead to significantly more negative
affect (<span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> = .04 [95% CI .01,
.06]).</p>

<div id="discussion" class="section level1">
<h1>Discussion</h1>
<p>This study, based on a representative panel study spanning 34 waves
within the Austrian population, investigated the impact of
COVID-19-related social media usage on well-being. The between-person
correlations revealed that increased engagement with COVID-19 content on
social media was associated with decreased well-being. For instance,
individuals consuming more COVID-19-related content reported slightly
lower life satisfaction, somewhat reduced positive affect, and notably
elevated negative affect compared to others.</p>
<p>To explore if these between-person correlations translated into
within-person effects, it was examined whether within-person changes in
media consumption corresponded with within-person changes in well-being.
As expected and aligned with the literature, increased consumption of
COVID-19 content did not significantly decrease well-being at a
meaningful level. While several statistically significant effects
emerged, their magnitudes were notably small. For instance, reading more
COVID-19 posts than usual slightly decreased positive affect. Liking and
sharing more COVID-19 content than usual were associated with slightly
higher negative affect. Posting more COVID-19 content reduced life
satisfaction slightly while elevating both positive and negative affect.
The effects, although statistically significant, fell within a
predefined range considered insignificant.</p>
<!-- Further analysis demonstrated that factors such as health and physical activity, which would be expected to have substantial impacts on well-being, indeed showed significant influences.  -->
<!-- Additionally, extended assessments covering one and four months did not yield meaningful effects.  -->
<!-- In summary, the influence of COVID-19-related social media activity on well-being was not substantial.  -->
<!-- This counters popular concerns over social media use during crises causing substantial well-being risks. -->
<p>That said, there is no consensus among scholars as to when effects
become practically relevant and meaningful. If we adopt a more liberal
and cautious perspective, the study indicates a tendency for
COVID-19-related social media usage to impact well-being negatively more
frequently than positively. Notably several statistically significant
negative effects were observed, contrasting with a single positive
effect. Hence, although effects were overall very small, the trend was
for effects to be negative.</p>
<p>These results align with prior research highlighting that social
media usage is rather associated with elevated negative affect but not
reduced life satisfaction <span class="citation">(Meier &amp; Reinecke,
2020)</span>.
<!-- The often extreme, negative, or aggressive tone of COVID-19 discussions on social media [@fanStigmatizationSocialMedia2020] could adversely impact more active authors.  -->
<!-- The negative effects may be explained by the consumption of negative and misleading information [@liYouTubeSourceInformation2020]. -->
The study suggests that varying communication types and channels warrant
separate analyses. Reading COVID-19 related content slightly reduced
positive affect, while liking, sharing, and posting increased negative
affect slightly. Posting COVID-19-related comments increased both
negative and positive affect slightly, while it reduced life
satisfaction.
<!-- This suggests that posting generates stronger reactions, both positive and negative.  -->
Posting COVID-19 content was more negative for Generation Z, potentially
reflecting broader negative effects of social media on this generation.
Together, this finding is aligned with recent work challenging the
assumption that active use is inherently beneficial and passive use
detrimental <span class="citation">(Valkenburg et al., 2022)</span>.
Notably, communication channels exhibited differences. Twitter and
YouTube appeared more negative, whereas Instagram, WhatsApp, and
Facebook were neutral.</p>
<!-- In conclusion, the study aligns with theoretical models and past research.  -->
<!-- It supports the notion of social media effects being small and contingent on communication type and channel [@meierComputermediatedCommunicationSocial2020a; @valkenburgDifferentialSusceptibilityMedia2013].  -->
<!-- Effects not being strongly negative also help explain why people spent so much time engaging with COVID-19 content on social media [@katzUsesGratificationsResearch1973; @zillmannMoodManagementCommunication1988]. -->
<p>Several limitations exist. While the study’s focus on within-person
effects enhances causal understanding, challenges exist related to
additional relevant confounding exogenous variables not included here
<span class="citation">(Rohrer, 2018)</span>, correct definition of the
SESOI <span class="citation">(Anvari &amp; Lakens, 2021)</span>, and
exact measurement of media use <span class="citation">(Scharkow,
2016)</span>. As noted above, different operationalizations of COVID-19
related social media use might lead to different results. For example,
the measures of social media use did not include interpersonal
communication about COVID-19 related content, which might result in more
positive outcomes <span class="citation">(Frison &amp; Eggermont,
2015)</span>. While this study did not find meaningful within-person
effects of social media use on well-being, between person analyses
revealed strong negative correlations. Alternative causal processes not
explored in this paper might explain these correlations. The study’s
results are applicable primarily to Western societies and may not hold
true in different cultural contexts.</p>
<p>The study’s findings conclude that COVID-19-related social media
activity minimally affects well-being, with other factors such as health
and physical activity playing more substantial roles. In light of these
minimal effects, concerns over COVID-19-related social media engagement
on well-being could not be substantiated.
<!-- When trying to improve well-being during a pandemic, instead of focusing on social media it seems more fruitful to address other, more pertinent societal problems related to health care, regular exercise, or psychological resilience. --></p>

<p>Conflicts of interest: The author declares no conflicts of interest.
Funding: This research did not receive external funding. Artificial
intelligence: Chat GPT was used for language polishing. Ethics: This
research complies with the Declaration of Helsinki (2023), aside from
the requirement to preregister human subjects research. Ethical review
and approval was not required for the study in accordance with the local
legislation and institutional requirements. The participants provided
their written informed consent to participate in this study.
Computational reproducibility: All analyses and the manuscript itself
are completely reproducible (<a

<p>Preregistration: The hypotheses, the sample, the measures, the
analyses, and the inference criteria (SESOI, <em>p</em>-value) were
preregistered on the Open Science Framework (<a
href="https://osf.io/87b24/?view_only=b2289b6fec214fa88ee75a18d45c18f3"
class="uri">https://osf.io/87b24/?view_only=b2289b6fec214fa88ee75a18d45c18f3</a>).
Because in this study data from an already existing data set was
analyzed, the preregistration was done prior to accessing the data. In
some cases, it was impossible to execute the analyses as originally
planned, for example because some properties of the variables only
became apparent when seeing the actual data. All changes are reported

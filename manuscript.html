<h1 class="title toc-ignore">The effects of COVID-19 related social
media use on well-being</h1>

<p class="abstract">Abstract</p>
In times of crisis such as the COVID-19 pandemic citizens need to stay
informed about recent events, political decisions, or mandatory
protection measures. To this end, many people use various types of
media, and increasingly social media. However, because social media are
particularly engaging, some find it hard to disconnect. In this
preregistered study, I investigated whether using social media for
COVID-19 related reasons affected psychological well-being. To answer
this question I analyzed data from the Austrian Corona Panel Project,
which consists of 3,485 participants. Well-being was measured at all 32
waves, and communication at six specific waves. I ran three random
effects within between models, controlling for several stable and
varying confounders. Results showed that the effects of COVID-19 related
social media use on well-being were very small, arguably too small to
matter. Fears that social media use during times of crisis critically
impairs well-being are not supported.
</div>

</div>


<p>During the COVID-19 pandemic, numerous events unfolded in quick
succession and several open questions emerged. How dangerous is the
virus? Is it spreading in my region? How is it transmitted, and how can
I protect myself? Because for many it was (and at the time of writing
still is) a matter of life or death, people aimed to stay informed
regarding the latest developments. Governments around the world
implemented safety measures, such as wearing masks, keeping physical
distance, or enforcing lockdowns. In this extraordinary situation, many
people heavily relied on media to obtain relevant information, and
especially social media were at an all time high <span
class="citation">(Statista, 2021)</span>.</p>
<p>Some people actually couldn’t stop using social media to learn about
COVID-19 related news. A new phenomenon emerged, termed “doomscrolling”:
Users were glued to their screens and found it hard to pursue other
relevant activities such as working, taking a break, or looking after
their children <span class="citation">(Klein, 2021)</span>. It was asked
whether using social media for COVID-19 related reasons is helpful, or
whether it creates an additional burden on mental health <span
class="citation">(Sandstrom et al., 2021)</span>. These concerns seem
justified: A study with 6,233 people from Germany conducted during the
pandemic found that “[f]requency, duration and diversity of media
exposure were positively associated with more symptoms of depression”
<span class="citation">(Bendau et al., 2021, p. 283)</span>.</p>
<p>As a result, with this study I want to build on this research and
investigate whether or not COVID-19 related social media use affected
well-being during the pandemic. To this end, I analyzed a large-scale
panel study from the Austrian Corona Panel Project <span
class="citation">(Kittel et al., 2020)</span>. The panel consists of
<strong>32</strong> waves and has an overall sample size of
<strong>3,485 participants</strong>.
<!-- At least 1,500 participants took part per wave, and the sample is representative of the Austrian population. -->
The panel study collected a large number of psychological and
demographic variables.
<!-- Being able to control for many confounding third variables, both stable and varying, together with the longitudinal design, this creates a unique opportunity  -->
I explicitly aimed to investigate the causal effects of COVID-19 related
social media use on well-being.</p>
<div id="understanding-well-being-and-media-use" class="section level2">
<h2>Understanding Well-being and Media Use</h2>
<p>The underlying theories that guided the selection of variables for my
analysis are the two-continua model of mental health <span
class="citation">(Greenspoon &amp; Saklofske, 2001)</span> and the
hierarchical taxonomy of computer-mediated communication <span
class="citation">(Meier &amp; Reinecke, 2020)</span>. According to the
two-continua model, mental health consists of (a) psychopathology and
(b) well-being.
<!-- Because the aim of this study is better to understand typical users and everyday contexts, my focus will be on well-being. -->
Well-being can be differentiated into subjective and psychological
well-being <span class="citation">(Diener et al., 2018)</span>. Whereas
subjective well-being emphasizes hedonic aspects such as happiness and
joy, psychological well-being addresses eudaimonic aspects such as
fulfillment and meaning. Subjective well-being is primarily about
achieving positive affect and avoiding negative affect. One of the most
prominent indicators of well-being is life satisfaction. In my view,
because it represents a general appraisal of one’s life, life
satisfaction is best thought of as a meta concept that combines
psychological and subjective well-being. Notably, life satisfaction is
stable and fluctuates only little, whereas it’s the exact opposite for
affect <span class="citation">(Dienlin &amp; Johannes, 2020)</span>.
<!-- Everyone can feel bad on any given day, but whether or not one feels generally comfortable in one's life rather changes across years. -->
To capture well-being in this study I thus build on life satisfaction,
positive affect, and negative affect. Together, this should provide an
encompassing perspective on potential media effects.</p>
<p>The hierarchical taxonomy of computer-mediated communication
differentiates six levels of how people engage with digital technology.
First, the device (e.g., smartphone); second, the type of application
(e.g., social networking site); third, the branded application (e.g.,
Twitter); fourth, the feature (e.g., status post); fifth, the
interaction (e.g., one-to-many); and sixth, the message (e.g., content)
<span class="citation">(Meier &amp; Reinecke, 2020)</span>. Whereas the
first four levels focus on the communication <em>channel</em>, the last
two address the communication <em>type</em>. <strong>Differentiating
different communication channels and communication types is important,
because the effects on well-being likely differ across communication
channels and communication types.</strong> <strong>Whereas active social
media use such as chatting is routinely linked to improved well-being,
passive use such as reading is considered more negative <span
class="citation">(Dienlin &amp; Johannes, 2020)</span>.</strong>
Similarly, branded apps are separate entities with potentially divergent
effects. For example, <span class="citation">Waterloo et al.
(2018)</span> found that it’s more adequate to express negative emotions
on WhatsApp than on Twitter or on Instagram. <strong>Especially during a
pandemic, it makes sense to analyze if users engage with COVID-19
related content on Instagram, where communication is more positive, or
on Facebook, where communication is more critical.</strong></p>
<p><strong>In this study, to measure the effects of social media use
focused on COVID-19 related news and topics, I adopt both the channel
and the type of communication perspective.</strong> <strong>Together,
this should offer a nuanced and comprehensive understanding of
communication.</strong> First, I investigate how well-being is affected
by different types of communication, namely active and passive use.
Defining what constitutes active and what passive use is not always
clear, and different understandings are currently discussed <span
class="citation">(Ellison et al., 2020; Meier &amp; Reinecke,
2020)</span>. Reading is generally considered as passive and writing as
active, while there are also specific behaviors such as liking or
sharing content that fall somewhere in-between <span
class="citation">(Meier &amp; Krause, 2022)</span>. In this study, I
hence distinguish (a) <em>reading</em> (passive), (b) <em>posting</em>
(active), and (c) <em>liking and sharing</em> COVID-19 related posts
(both active and passive). Second, I analyze how using the most
prominent branded applications affects well-being, and whether this
effect changes across applications. The branded applications
investigated here are Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, WhatsApp, and
YouTube—which were, at the time of writing, the most relevant social
media apps.</p>
<p><strong>Worth noting, this study is not about <em>general</em> social
media use during times of COVID, but on social media use
<em>focused</em> on COVID-19 related content.</strong> <strong>For
example, posting thoughts about the pandemic, reading posts and
comments, or retweeting COVID-19 related news.</strong></p>

<div id="theorizing-social-media-effects-on-well-being"
class="section level2">
<h2>Theorizing Social Media Effects on Well-Being</h2>
<!-- In conclusion, most effects are likely somewhere between trivial and small. -->
<!-- I therefore expect that also in the case of COVID-19 related social media use effects will be trivial to small. -->
<p>From a theoretical perspective, how could we explain whether COVID-19
related social media use affects well-being?
<!-- In what follows, I outline potential arguments as to why the effect might be positive or negative, direct or indirect, or nonexistent. -->
According to the set-point model of subjective well-being, well-being is
surprisingly stable <span class="citation">(Lykken, 1999)</span>.
Although specific events such as marriage or salary can have significant
effects, after some time well-being routinely returns to prior levels,
which are mostly determined genetically <span class="citation">(Sheldon
&amp; Lucas, 2014)</span>. Only very specific events and factors such as
unemployment, disability, or death can cause long-term changes in
well-being <span class="citation">(Lucas, 2007)</span>.
<!-- So although well-being can change this does not happen easily. -->
<!-- Although the set-point theory has been criticized lately because events such as marriage, unemployment, or death can indeed lead to long-term changes, it is still widely maintained that well-being is very stable and hence hard to be influenced  --></p>
<p>Can media use be such a factor? In advance, there doesn’t seem to be
a clear winner, and it’s likely that both positive and negative effects
cancel each other out. Empirically, social media use on average does not
have a strong effect on well-being <span class="citation">(Meier &amp;
Reinecke, 2020)</span>. According to the Differential Susceptibility to
Media Effects Model <span class="citation">(Valkenburg &amp; Peter,
2013)</span>, the effects of media use differ across individuals
<strong>and content</strong>. Whereas for some media are beneficial, for
others they are harmful. <strong>Whereas some content provides
opportunities (education, advice), other content creates risks
(misinformation, hate). <span class="citation">(Livingstone et al.,
2018)</span>.</strong> Social media can impair well-being when causing
embarrassment, stress, or disinformation, and they can improve
well-being when providing connectedness, information, or entertainment
<span class="citation">(Büchi, 2021)</span>. On average, however,
effects are often small or negligible.</p>
<p><strong>Two of the most prominent media effect theories argue
(indirectly) against strong average negative impacts.</strong>
<strong>According to mood management theory <span
class="citation">(Zillmann, 1988)</span>, using media substantially
affects people’s moods.</strong> <strong>Effects can be stimulating or
overwhelming, relaxing or boring.</strong> <strong>After some time,
users implicitly learn what media help them balance their mood and
affect according to their own situational needs <span
class="citation">(Zillmann, 1988)</span>.</strong> <strong>Those media
that eventually become part of one’s media repertoire are hence, on
average, beneficial for users and their moods.</strong> <strong>Using
experience sampling of well-being and logs of social media use, a study
with 82 participants from Italy found that after episodes of social
media use, levels of positive affect increased significantly <span
class="citation">(Marciano et al., 2022)</span>.</strong></p>
<p><strong>While mood management theory considers media use mainly
driven by implicit learning experiences, uses and gratifications theory
upholds that the process is more explicit and rational <span
class="citation">(Katz et al., 1973)</span>.</strong> <strong>Users
select those media that they expect to have a desired effect, for
example on mood, knowledge, or entertainment.</strong> <strong>If those
beneficial media effects do not exist or if they are not expected,
people will spend their time elsewhere.</strong> <strong>And social
media offer several beneficial effects, explaining why they are used
that much.</strong> <strong>They help find relevant information,
maintain and foster relationships, express one’s personality, and
entertain oneself <span class="citation">(Pelletier et al.,
2020)</span>.</strong> <strong>In conclusion, because people spend so
much time on social media consuming COVID-19 related content, according
to both mood management theory and uses and gratifications theory we
wouldn’t expect to find strong average negative effects.</strong></p>
<p>But people can also misjudge media effects and are often overly
optimistic <span class="citation">(Metzger &amp; Suh, 2017)</span>. And
precisely because social media have so many positive consequences, one
can ask if this is not where the actual problem lies. In other words,
social media aren’t problematic because they’re inherently bad, but
rather because they’re too good. And as with many other things, there
can be too much of a good thing. It is therefore often asked whether
social media are addictive, and users sometimes express this fear
themselves <span class="citation">(Yang et al., 2021)</span>. However, a
recently published meta-analysis found that the two most prominent
measures of addiction, the Bergen Facebook Addiction Scale and the
Bergen Social Media Addiction Scale, have only small relations to
well-being <span class="citation">(Duradoni et al., 2020)</span>. In
addition, the general idea of labeling excessive social and new media
use as addiction was criticized, arguing that social media represent new
regular behaviors that should not be pathologized <span
class="citation">(Galer, 2018; van Rooij et al., 2018)</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Because media effects can differ across users, situations,
and content <span class="citation">(Livingstone et al., 2018; Valkenburg
&amp; Peter, 2013)</span>, I now briefly focus on the effects of
COVID-19 related social media use specifically.</strong> First, one
could assume a <em>direct</em> negative effect on well-being, and
especially on positive or negative affect, which are more volatile and
fluctuating. Dangers, inequalities, corruption—these were the headlines
during the pandemic across many countries worldwide. If one learns about
such events, the initial reaction might be shock, fear, or dismay.
Consuming such news can be depressing <span class="citation">(Dörnemann
et al., 2021)</span>, perhaps even changing some general perspectives on
life.
<!-- So, just like being hit by a hammer hurts and we don't need any "mediating mechanism", this could be the case here as well. -->
That said, because not all news was negative, and because many people
showed solidarity and compassion, there was also positive and uplifting
content, potentially compensating for the negative effects <span
class="citation">(Dörnemann et al., 2021)</span>. A study with 2.057
respondents from Italy reported that during the pandemic virtual
community and social connectedness even increased during the pandemic
<span class="citation">(Guazzini et al., 2022)</span>. <strong>In
Finland, in a sample of 735 participants, levels of loneliness did not
decrease during the pandemic, and people who engaged more on social
media showed less loneliness <span class="citation">(Latikka et al.,
2022)</span>.</strong>
<!-- However, in light of a worldwide pandemic with millions of deaths, the negative direct effect seems more plausible. --></p>
<p>There could also be <em>indirect</em> effects. When browsing social
media for COVID-19 related news, many users reported being captivated to
such an extent that they could not stop using social media <span
class="citation">(Klein, 2021)</span>. During the pandemic social media
use was at an all-time high in the US <span class="citation">(Statista,
2021)</span>. Although it is most likely that moderate social media use
is not detrimental <span class="citation">(Orben, 2020)</span>, overuse,
however, might be more critical, and several studies have shown more
pronounced negative effects for extreme users <span
class="citation">(Przybylski &amp; Weinstein, 2017)</span>. To explain,
overuse could impair well-being if it replaces meaningful or functional
activities such as meeting others, working, actively relaxing, or
exercising. <strong>Another potentially negative mechanism at play are
problematic social comparison processes. During the pandemic, several
users shared how they successfully dealt with challenges such as
physical distancing. In a study with 1131 residents from Wuhan in China
<span class="citation">(Yue et al., 2022)</span>, people who spent more
time in quarantine also spent more time on social media. Those, who
spent more time on social media also engaged in more upward social
comparison, which was related to increased levels of stress.</strong>
<!-- Therefore, if a society collectively overuses social media during a pandemic, there is potential for negative effects. -->
<!-- If overuse replaces such activities it's reasonable to assume that it's also detrimental. --></p>
<p>On the other hand, one can make the case that using social media for
COVID-19 related reasons might even be beneficial, especially in times
of a pandemic. Exchanging COVID-19 related messages with friends via
WhatsApp might replace the in-person contact one would have otherwise,
but which is literally impossible at the time. In situations where
meaningful and functional activities are prohibited, using social media
to exchange about COVID-19 related topics might not be the worst idea.
Besides, given that nowadays a large number of experts, scientists, and
politicians converse directly on social media, one can get first-hand
high quality information on current developments.
<!-- On the other hand, there is of course also much disinformation, and "bingeing" on COVID-19 fake news might also pose risks for impaired well-being. --></p>
<p>To summarize, from a theoretical perspective it is most likely that
the average effects of social media use on well-being are negligible.
Building on established theories from Communication, we would not assume
that effects are either profoundly negative or strongly positive.</p>

<h2>Empirical Studies on Social Media Effects</h2>
<p>So far, there is only little empirical research on how well-being is
affected by COVID-19 related social media. In their study on the
relations between media use and mental health during the pandemic, <span
class="citation">Bendau et al. (2021)</span> found that people who used
social media as a primary source of information reported on average
“significantly more unspecific anxiety and depression [] and
significantly more specific COVID-19 related anxiety symptoms” (p. 288).
<span class="citation">Eden et al. (2020)</span> analyzed the media use
of 425 US college students during the first wave of the pandemic,
finding both positive and negative relations with well-being. In a
sample of 312 respondents collected via Amazon Mechanical Turk, <span
class="citation">Choi &amp; Choung (2021)</span> reported that people
who used media to attain information were more lonely and less satisfied
with their lives. <span class="citation">Stainback et al. (2020)</span>
analyzed a large-scale study with 11,537 respondents from the US and
found that increased COVID-19 media consumption was related to more
psychological distress. A four-wave panel study with 384 young adults
from the U.S. analyzed the effects of general digital technology
use—objectively measured via screenshots of screen-time applications—on
mental health, separating within- and between-person relations <span
class="citation">(Sewall et al., 2021)</span>. The results showed that
digital technology did not have any significant effects on mental health
<span class="citation">(for a similar study with comparable results, see
Bradley &amp; Howard, 2021)</span>. Together, the literature is mixed,
with a slight focus on the negative effects of social media as news use
<span class="citation">(see also Dörnemann et al., 2021; Liu &amp; Tong,
2020; Riehm et al., 2020)</span>. However, note that all of these
findings represent between-person relations stemming from
cross-sectional data (see below). We therefore don’t know whether the
differences in mental health and well-being are due to social media use
or due to other third variables, such as age, health, employment, or
education.</p>
<p>The question of whether and how social media use affects well-being
<em>in general</em>, on the other hand, is well-researched. This also
holds true for the different types of communication such as active or
passive use. A meta review (i.e., an analysis of meta-analyses) found
that the relation between social media use and well-being is likely in
the negative spectrum but very small <span class="citation">(Meier &amp;
Reinecke, 2020)</span>—potentially too small to matter. What determines
whether or not an effect is considered small or trivial? As a starting
point, we could refer to standardized effect sizes. According to <span
class="citation">Cohen (1992)</span>, small effect sizes start at
<em>r</em> = .10. And indeed, several if not most of the current
meta-analyses find effect sizes below that threshold <span
class="citation">(Ferguson et al., 2021; Huang, 2017; Meier &amp;
Reinecke, 2020)</span>.</p>
<p>Finally, also several individual studies employing advanced methods
found smalls relations between social media use and well-being <span
class="citation">(Keresteš &amp; Štulhofer, 2020; Orben et al., 2019;
Przybylski et al., 2021; Schemer et al., 2021)</span>. For example,
<span class="citation">Beyens et al. (2021)</span> reported that
although for some users (roughly one quarter) the effects of social
media use on well-being were negative, for almost the same number of
users they were positive, while for the rest the effects were neutral.
This finding is aligned with the Differential Susceptibility to Media
Effects Model: Although there is substantial <em>variation</em> of media
effects for individual users, the <em>average</em> effects reported in
the literature are often small <span class="citation">(Valkenburg &amp;
Peter, 2013)</span>.</p>
<!-- Together, the strongest argument to me is that _in general_ the effects of social media on well-being are, on average, small at best.  -->
<!-- Because this study only looks at _one part_ of social media use---namely, COVID-19 related interactions---it is very focused, diminishing the overall potential of the effects even further. -->
<!-- Whether or not using social media for COVID-19 related aspects is detrimental during a pandemic is also not entirely clear. -->
<!-- At least, there does not seem to be a case where we should expect a clear deviation to the negative, despite anecdotes of doomscrolling. -->
<p>In conclusion, in light of the theoretical considerations and
empirical studies presented above, I expect that COVID-19 related
communication on social media doesn’t affect well-being in a meaningful
or relevant way. <strong>This general hypothesis will be analyzed
specifically for the communication types of (a) time spent reading, (b)
liking and sharing, and (c) actively posting COVID-19 related
content.</strong> <strong>In addition, I will analyze how well-being is
influenced by spending time on five prominent social media apps,
including (a) Facebook, (b) Instagram, (c) Twitter, (d) WhatsApp, and
(e) YouTube.</strong> <strong>Three different well-being indicators will
be differentiated: life satisfaction, positive affect, and negative
affect.</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hypothesis: The within-person effects of all types of COVID-19
related social media use on all types of well-being indicators—while
controlling for several stable and varying covariates such as
sociodemographic variables and psychological dispositions—will be
trivial.</p>
</blockquote>

<div id="current-study" class="section level1">
<h1>Current Study</h1>
<div id="smallest-effect-size-of-interest" class="section level2">
<h2>Smallest Effect Size of Interest</h2>
<p>Testing this hypothesis, however, is not trivial. First, in contrast
to most hypotheses typically posited in the social sciences it
implicitly contains an effect size, a so-called smallest effect size of
interest (SESOI). Effectively testing this hypothesis necessitates
defining what’s considered a “trivial effect size” and what’s not. Above
I already referred to standardized effect sizes. However, standardized
effect sizes should only be a first step toward evaluating an effect’s
relevance <span class="citation">(Baguley, 2009)</span>. Standardized
effect sizes are determined by a sample’s variance,<a href="#fn1"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> which is problematic:
The question of whether or not social media use affects a particular
person in a relevant way should not depend on the variance in the sample
in which that person’s data were collected. Instead, it should depend on
absolute criteria.</p>
<p>What could be a minimally interesting, nontrivial effect? Because
this is a normative and ultimately philosophical question, there can
never be a clear, single, or unanimous answer.
<!-- In the end, it is a personal question. --> However, it is still
necessary and helpful to try to provide such a plausible benchmark. I
therefore suggest the following SESOI for this research question:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>SESOI: If a heavy user of COVID-19 related social media news suddenly
<em>stops</em> using social media altogether, this should have a
<em>noticeable</em> impact on their overall well-being.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What does this mean practically and how can it be operationalized? In
this study, COVID-19 related social media use was measured on a 5-point
scale, ranging from 1 = <em>never</em> to 5 = <em>several times a
day</em>. Thus, a change of four units in social media use (e.g., a
complete stop) should correspond to a noticeable change in well-being.
But what’s a noticeable change in well-being? According to <span
class="citation">Norman et al. (2003)</span>, people can reliably
distinguish <em>seven</em> levels of satisfaction with health. So if
satisfaction is measured on a 7-point scale, we would state that a four
unit change in social media use should result in a one unit change in
life satisfaction. (For more information, see Methods section “Inference
Criteria.”)</p>
</div>
<div id="causality" class="section level2">
<h2>Causality</h2>
<p>The hypothesis explicitly states a causal effect. In non-experimental
studies, longitudinal designs can help investigate causality. Using
longitudinal designs alone, however, is not sufficient for establishing
correct causal statements <span class="citation">(Rohrer &amp; Murayama,
2021)</span>. In addition, we for example also need to control for
confounding third variables. <strong>Importantly, when analyzing
longitudinal (within-person) relationships and effects, it is important
to control for <em>varying</em> third variables.</strong>
<strong>Non-varying third variables only help control non-varying
(between-person) relations.</strong></p>
<p>To illustrate, consider the following example. Imagine that a person
suddenly starts using social media much more than usual, and then after
some time becomes less satisfied with their life. Eventually, use and
life satisfaction return to prior levels. If this happens to several
people at the same time, in a longitudinal study we could then observe a
significant effect of social media use on life satisfaction. However, it
could also be the case that during the study there was a major exogenous
event (say, a pandemic), which caused large parts of the working
population to loose their jobs. Hence, the causal effect reported above
was confounded, because in reality it was the pandemic that caused both
social media use to rise and life satisfaction to go down.</p>
<p>Thus, only when controlling for <em>all</em> relevant confounders,
can we correctly estimate causality without bias <span
class="citation">(Rohrer, 2018)</span>. Obviously, we can never be
entirely sure to have included all confounders, which makes absolute
statements regarding causality virtually impossible. In addition, when
determining the overall causal effect, we need to make sure <em>not</em>
to control for mediating variables <span class="citation">(Rohrer,
2018)</span>, for doing so would bias our assessment of the causal
effect. Complicating matters further, it is often unclear if a variable
is a mediator or a confounder.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> However, despite all these caveats, when
controlling for relevant variables (that aren’t mediators), we can be
much more certain that we measured causality correctly. The aim should
therefore be to collect as many varying and non-varying confounders as
possible (which I believe is seldom done in our field), while knowing
that absolute certainty regarding causality cannot be reached.</p>
<p>When searching for suitable candidates for confounders, we should
look for variables that affect both media use and well-being.
Controlling for these factors isolates the actual effect of social media
use on well-being. We can also control for variables that affect only
social media use or well-being. However, in doing so not much is gained
or lost, because the effects of social media use would remain virtually
the same <span class="citation">(Kline, 2016; but see McElreath,
2021)</span>.</p>
<p>In this study, I hence plan to control for the following variables,
which either have already been shown to affect both social media use and
well-being or which are likely to do so, and which also aren’t
mediators:
<!-- (I'll additionally include variables that likely affect only well-being, also to obtain a comparison benchmark for social media effects): -->
gender, age, education, Austria country of birth, Austria country of
birth of parents, text-based news consumption, video-based news
consumption, residency Vienna, household size, health, living space,
access to garden, access to balcony, employment, work hours per week,
being in home-office, household income, outdoor activities, satisfaction
with democracy, disposition to take risks, and locus of control.<a
href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a>
<!-- I will not control for variables such as trust in institutions or trust in media, because these variables might be influenced by social media use to a meaningful extent. --></p>
<p>Next to including covariates, it’s now increasingly understood that
causal effects should be analyzed from an internal, within-person
perspective <span class="citation">(Hamaker, 2014)</span>. If a specific
person changes their media diet, we need to measure how this behavior
affects <em>their own</em> well-being. Between-person comparisons from
cross-sectional data, where participants are interviewed only once,
cannot provide such insights. In this study, I hence differentiate
between-person relations from within-person effects. And as explicated
above, to test the hypothesis I thus consider only the within-person
effects.</p>
<p>Finally, one precondition of causality is temporal order. The cause
needs to precede the effect. Finding the right interval between cause
and effect is crucial. For example, if we want to understand the effect
of alcohol consumption on driving performance, it makes a big difference
if driving performance is measured one minute, one hour, one day, or one
week after consumption.
<!-- Finding the right interval is difficult. --> If variables are
stable, longer intervals are needed; if they fluctuate, shorter
intervals. In the case of well-being, we need shorter intervals for
<strong>the more fluctuating</strong> positive and negative affect and
longer ones for <strong>the more stable</strong> life satisfaction <span
class="citation">(Dienlin &amp; Johannes, 2020)</span>. <strong>Using
social media can have instant effects on mood <span
class="citation">(Marciano et al., 2022)</span>.</strong>
<strong>Effects on life satisfaction often take longer to manifest, for
example because media use leads to actual changes in specific behaviors,
which then affect life satisfaction <span class="citation">(Dienlin et
al., 2017)</span>.</strong> Choosing the right interval is challenging,
because especially short intervals are hard to implement in practice,
often requiring advanced methods such as experience sampling (also known
as in situ measurement or ambulant assessment) <span
class="citation">(Schnauber-Stockmann &amp; Karnowski, 2020)</span>. In
this study, I hence analyze how using social media during the last week
affected positive and negative affect during the same week. In other
words, if people during the last week engaged in more COVID-19 related
social media use than they usually do, did they feel better or worse
during that week than they usually do? Regarding life satisfaction, I
implemented a longer interval. If people during the last week used
COVID-19 related social media more than they usually do, were they at
the end of the week more or less satisfied with their lives than they
usually are? I hence analyze if when a person changes their social media
diet, are there (a) <em>simultaneous</em> changes in their affect and
(b) <em>subsequent</em> changes in their life satisfaction?
<strong>These relations will be controlled for varying confounders,
which fosters a causal interpretation.</strong> Similar approaches were
implemented by other studies <span class="citation">(Johannes et al.,
2022; Scharkow et al., 2020)</span>, and they are considered a best
practice approach toward analyzing causality <span

<h1>Method</h1>
<p>In this section I describe the preregistration and how I determined
the sample size, data exclusions, the analyses, and all measures in the
study.</p>
<div id="preregistration" class="section level2">
<h2>Preregistration</h2>
<p>The hypotheses, the sample, the measures, the analyses, and the
inference criteria (SESOI, p-value) were preregistered on the Open
Science Framework. The (anonymous) preregistration can be accessed here:
<a
href="https://osf.io/87b24/?view_only=b2289b6fec214fa88ee75a18d45c18f3"
class="uri">https://osf.io/87b24/?view_only=b2289b6fec214fa88ee75a18d45c18f3</a>.
Because in this study I analyzed data from an already existing
large-scale data set, all of these steps were done prior to accessing
the data. The preregistration was designed on the basis of the panel
documentation online <span class="citation">(Kittel et al.,
2020)</span>. In some cases I couldn’t execute the analyses as I had
originally planned, for example because some properties of the variables
only became apparent when inspecting the actual data. The most relevant
deviations are reported below, and a complete list of all changes can be
found in the online <a

</div>
<div id="sample" class="section level2">
<h2>Sample</h2>
<p><strong>The data come from the Austrian Corona Panel Project <span
class="citation">(Kittel et al., 2021)</span>, which is a large-scale
standalone panel study. </strong> <strong>The data are hosted on AUSSDA
and are publicly available here: <a
href="https://doi.org/10.11587/28KQNS"
class="uri">https://doi.org/10.11587/28KQNS</a>.</strong> <strong>At the
time of writing, the official website included a data-set consisting of
24 waves. </strong> <strong>For the analyses presented here, I was able
to receive an advance version consisting of all 32 waves.</strong>
<strong>The study was conducted between March 2020 and June 2022, and
data collection is now officially finished.</strong> <strong>It contains
32 waves.</strong> Between March 2020 and July 2020, the intervals were
weekly, and afterward the intervals were monthly. Each wave consists of
at least 1,500 respondents. The overall sample size was <em>N</em> =
3,485, and 111,520 observations were collected. Panel mortality was
compensated through a continuous acquisition of new participants. All
respondents needed to have access to the internet (via computer or
mobile devices such as smartphones or tablets). They were sampled from a
pre-existing online access panel provided by the company Marketagent,
Austria. Respondents were asked and incentivized with 180 credit points
to participate in each wave of the panel.</p>
<p>Achieved via quota sampling, the sample matched the Austrian
population in terms of age, gender, region/state, municipality size, and
educational level. In order to participate in the study, the respondents
needed to be Austrian residents and had to be at least 14 years of age.
Ethical review and approval was not required for the study in accordance
with the local legislation and institutional requirements. The
participants provided their written informed consent to participate in
this study. The average age was 41 years, 49 percent were male, 14
percent had a University degree, and 5 percent were currently
unemployed.</p>
</div>
<div id="inference-criteria" class="section level2">
<h2>Inference Criteria</h2>
<p>Because the data were analyzed post-hoc, no a-priori sample size
planning on the basis of power analyses was conducted. The sample is
large, and it is hence well-equipped to reliably detect small effects.
<!-- , which is why no exact post hoc power analysis were conducted. -->
In addition, because such large samples easily generate significant
<em>p</em>-values even for very small effects, it helps that the
hypotheses were tested with a smallest effect size of interest-approach.
To this end, I adopted the interval testing approach as proposed by
<span class="citation">Dienes (2014)</span>. On the basis of the SESOI,
I then defined a null region. In what follows, I explain how I
determined the SESOI and the null region.</p>
<p>In this study, life satisfaction was measured on an 11-point scale.
If people can reliably differentiate 7 levels as mentioned above, this
corresponds to 11 / 7 = 1.57 unit change on an 11-point scale. Hence, a
four-point change in media use (e.g., a complete stop) should result in
a 1.57-point change in life satisfaction. In a statistical regression
analysis, <em>b</em> estimates the change in the dependent variable if
the independent variable increases by one point. We would therefore
expect a SESOI of <em>b</em> = 1.57 / 4 = 0.39. For affect, which was
measured on a 5-point scale, our SESOI would be <em>b</em> = 0.71 / 4 =
0.18. Because we’re agnostic as to whether the effects are positive or
negative, the null region includes negative and positive effects.
Finally, in order not to exaggerate precision and to be less
conservative, these numbers are reduced to nearby thresholds.<a
href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> Together,
this leads to a null region ranging from <em>b</em> = -.30 to <em>b</em>
= .30 for life satisfaction, and <em>b</em> = -.15 to <em>b</em> = .15
for positive and negative affect.</p>
<!-- As explained above, for well-being the null region was between _b_ = -.30 and _b_ = .30 (i.e., _b_ = |.30|). -->
<p>Let’s briefly illustrate what this means in practice. If the 95%
confidence interval falls completely within the null-region (e.g.,
<em>b</em> = .20, [95% CI: .15, .25]), the hypothesis that the effect is
trivial is supported. If the confidence interval and the null region
overlap (e.g., <em>b</em> = .30, [95% CI: .25, .35]), the hypothesis is
not supported and the results are considered inconclusive, while a
meaningful negative effect is rejected. If the confidence interval falls
completely outside of the null-region (e.g., <em>b</em> = .40, [95% CI:
.35, .45]), the hypothesis is rejected and the existence of a meaningful
positive effect is supported. For an illustration, see Figure
@ref(fig:sesoi)).</p>
<!-- Responses were individually checked for patterns such as straight-lining or missing of inverted items. -->
<!-- X clear cases were removed. -->
</div>
<div id="data-analysis" class="section level2">
<h2>Data Analysis</h2>
<p>The hypothesis was analyzed using mixed effects models, namely random
effect within-between models (REWB)<span class="citation">(Bell et al.,
2019)</span>. Three models were run, one for each dependent variable.
The data were hierarchical, and responses were separately nested in
participants and waves (i.e., participants and waves were implemented as
random effects). Nesting in participants allowed to separate
between-person relations from within-person effects. Nesting in waves
allowed to control for general exogenous developments, such as general
decreases in well-being in the population, for example due to lockdown
measures. Thus, there was no need additionally to control for specific
phases or measures of the lockdown. Predictors were modeled as fixed
effects. They included social media communication types and channels,
separated into within and between-person factors, as well as stable and
varying covariates. All predictors were included simultaneously and in
each of the three models.</p>
<p>The factorial validity of the scales were tested with confirmatory
factor analyses (CFA). Because Mardia’s test showed that the assumption
of multivariate normality was violated, I used the more robust
Satorra-Bentler scaled and mean-adjusted test statistic (MLM) as
estimator. To avoid over-fitting, I tested the scales on more liberal
fit criteria (CFI &gt; .90, TLI &gt; .90, RMSEA &lt;. .10, SRMR &lt;
.10) <span class="citation">(Kline, 2016)</span>.
<!-- Finally, REWB-models cannot model latent variables. -->
<!-- To increase precision, I therefore exported factor scores from the CFAs for positive and negative affect. -->
Mean scores were used for positive and negative affect.
<!-- Respondents who answered less than 50% of all questions were removed. -->
<strong>Missing responses were imputed using multiple imputation with
predictive mean matching (five iterations, five data-sets), including
categorical variables.</strong> <strong>All variables were imputed
except the media use measures, as they were not collected on each
wave.</strong> <strong>All variables included in the analyses presented
here were used to impute missing data.</strong> <strong>For the main
analyses, results were pooled across all five data-sets.</strong></p>

was “How often in the last week have you followed information related to
the Corona-crisis on the following social media?” The five items were

<h3>Control variables</h3>
<p>The effects of COVID-19 related social media use were controlled for

age, (c) education (ten options), (d) Austria country of birth (yes/no),
(e) Austria parents’ country of birth (no parent, one parent, both
parents). I originally planned to implement additional variables as
varying covariates. However, because they were not measured often enough
or not at the time when social media use was measured, I implemented
them as stable variables using their average values across all waves.
This includes (a) text-based media news consumption (five degrees), (b)
video-based media news consumption (five degrees), (c) residency is
Vienna (yes/no), (d) self-reported physical health (five degrees), (e)
living space (eleven options), (f) access to balcony (yes/no), (g)
access to garden (yes/no), (h) employment (nine options), (i)
disposition to take risks (eleven degrees), and (j) locus of control
(five degrees). I also controlled for the following varying covariates:
(a) five items measuring outdoor activities such as sport or meeting
friends (five degrees), and (b) satisfaction with democracy (five
degrees). Because it lead to too much attrition in the sample, I did not
control for (a) household size, (b) work hours per week, (c) home

<div id="results" class="section level1">
<h1>Results</h1>
<p>First, when looking at the variables from a descriptive perspective
(Figure @ref(fig:fig-descriptives)), we see that all well-being measures
did not change substantially across the different waves of data
collection. COVID-19 related media use, however, decreased slightly at
the beginning of the study and remained stable after approximately six
waves. The initial decrease might be explained by the fact that the
collection of data began at the end of March 2020, hence approximately
three months after the pandemic began. It could be that after an initial
uptick, COVID-19 related social media use was already declining at the
time, returning to more normal levels.</p>
<div id="preregistered-analyses" class="section level2">
<h2>Preregistered Analyses</h2>
<p>The study’s main hypothesis was that the effects of social media use
on well-being would be trivial. Regarding the effects of different
communication <em>types</em>—that is, reading vs. sharing
vs. posting—all within-person effects fell completely within the
a-priori defined null region (see Figure @ref(fig:fig-between)). For
example, respondents who used social media more frequently than usual to
read about COVID-19 related topics did not show a simultaneous change in
life satisfaction (<em>b</em> = 0.04 [95% CI -0.01, 0.09]). As a result,
the hypothesis was supported for all COVID-19 related types of social
media communication. <strong>However, two effects were statistically
significantly different from zero.</strong> <strong>Users who wrote more
COVID-19 related posts than usual were also slightly less satisfied with
their lives as usual (<em>b</em> = -0.13 [95% CI -0.21,
-0.05]).</strong> <strong>Users who wrote more COVID-19 related posts
than usual also experienced slightly more negative affect than usual
(<em>b</em> = 0.03 [95% CI 0.01, 0.05]).</strong> <strong>There was a
small and statistically non-significant trend that reading COVID-19
related content slightly increased life satisfaction (<em>b</em> = 0.04
[95% CI -0.01, 0.09], <em>p</em> = .078).</strong> <strong>At the same
time, there was also a small and statistically non-significant trend
that reading COVID-19 related content decreased positive affect
(<em>b</em> = -0.02 [95% CI -0.03, 0], <em>p</em> = .078).</strong></p>
<p>Regarding the COVID-19 related use of social media <em>channels</em>,
the results were comparable (see Figure @ref(fig:fig-within)). Changes
in the frequency of using different social media channels to attain
information regarding COVID-19 were unrelated to meaningful changes in
well-being. For example, respondents who used Facebook more frequently
than usual to learn about COVID-19 did not show a simultaneous change in
well-being (<em>b</em> = -0.04 [95% CI -0.09, 0.02]). In sum, the
hypothesis was supported also for the COVID-19 related use of important
social media channels. <strong>However, two effects differed
substantially from zero.</strong> <strong>Respondents who used Instagram
more frequently than usual to attain COVID-19 related news reported
slightly <em>lower</em> levels of negative affect than usual (<em>b</em>
= -0.02 [95% CI -0.03, &gt; -0.01]).</strong> <strong>Respondents who
used YouTube more frequently than usual to attain COVID-19 related news
reported slightly <em>higher</em> levels of negative affect than usual
(<em>b</em> = 0.02 [95% CI 0, 0.03]).</strong> <strong>However, both
effects were still completely inside of the null region, hence not large
enough to be considered meaningful.</strong></p>

<h2>Exploratory Analyses</h2>
<p>In what follows, I briefly report some exploratory analyses that
weren’t preregistered.</p>
<div id="between-person-relations" class="section level3">
<h3>Between-person relations</h3>
<p>For between-person relations, no a-priori hypotheses were formulated.
Results showed that no relation crossed or was completely outside of the
SESOI. Four relations were statistically significant.
<strong>Respondents who across all waves used social media more
frequently than others to read about COVID-19 related posts reported
slightly lower levels of positive affect than others (<em>b</em> = -0.05
[95% CI -0.02, -0.08]).</strong> <strong>Respondents who across all
waves used social media more frequently than others to write COVID-19
related posts reported slightly higher levels of negative affect than
others (<em>b</em> = 0.06 [95% CI 0.10, 0.03]).</strong> <strong>At the
same time, respondents who across all waves used social media more
frequently than others to write COVID-19 related posts also reported
slightly higher levels of positive affect (<em>b</em> = 0.06 [95% CI
0.11, 0.01]).</strong> <strong>Finally, respondents who across all waves
used YouTube more frequently than others also reported slightly higher
levels of life satisfaction than others (<em>b</em> = 0.09 [95% CI 0.16,
0.02]).</strong>
<!-- However, note that the effect were still completely inside of the null region, hence not large enough to be considered practically relevant. --></p>
<p>Note that when comparing the results with and without control
variables, the results differed. For example, on the between-person
level, one effect stopped being significant if controlled for additional
variables. Actively posting on social media was significantly (though
not meaningfully) related to decreased life satisfaction. However, when
controlling for potential confounders, the effect became virtually
zero.</p>
<p>For an overview of all between-person relations, see Figure
@ref(fig:fig-between).</p>
</div>
<div id="covariates" class="section level3">
<h3>Covariates</h3>
<p>To contextualize the results reported above and to see if the results
included any meaningful effects at all, I also looked at the effect
sizes of the covariates. Because each variable had different response
options, we would actually need to define a SESOI for each variable,
which for reasons of scope I cannot implement here. Therefore, I report
the results of the standardized scales, which allows for a better
comparison across the differently scaled variables. As a rough estimate
for the SESOI we can build on the typical convention that small effects
start at <em>r</em> = |.10|. The results showed that several effects
crossed or fell outside of the SESOI, were hence considered meaningful.
This includes for example internal locus of control, health,
satisfaction with democracy, or exercising. For an overview, see Figure
@ref(fig:fig-control).</p>
</div>
<div id="robustness-check" class="section level3">
<h3>Robustness-check</h3>
<p>To find out whether my inferences were robust across legitimate
(though arguably inferior) alternative analyses, I reran the analyses
also using standardized estimates, mean scores instead of factor scores,
and with a data set where missing data were not imputed. The results
were virtually the same. For example, all within-person standardized
COVID-19 related types of social media use or channels were
significantly smaller than <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> =
|.05|, again supporting that effects were negligible. The results of the
standardized analyses are reported in Table @ref(tab:tab-within). The
additional analyses are reported on the <a

<div id="discussion" class="section level1">
<h1>Discussion</h1>
<p>In this study I analyzed the effects of COVID-19 related social media
use on well-being. The data come from a panel study with 32 waves and
are largely representative of the Austrian population. In a random
effects model I separated between person relations from within-person
effects and controlled for a large number of both stable and varying
covariates, thereby aiming to assess causality. The results showed that
some statistically significant negative within-person effects existed,
but that they were <strong>very small and likely</strong> trivial.
People who used social media more than usual to learn about COVID-19
didn’t show meaningful changes in their well-being.</p>
<p>The results imply that COVID-19 related social media use doesn’t seem
to be particularly relevant for well-being. Other factors among the
third variables that were measured revealed larger effects or relations,
suggesting that well-being is rather determined by alternative aspects
such as health, satisfaction with democracy, locus of control, or
exercising. According to this study, popular fears that “doomscrolling”
or overusing social media during times of crises is detrimental are not
supported.</p>
<p><strong>That said, several preliminary and subtle trends can be
observed.</strong> <strong>First, overall the results do suggest that
effects of COVID-19 related social media use on well-being rather tend
to take place in the negative as opposed to the positive
spectrum.</strong> <strong>For example, people who wrote more COVID-19
related posts than usual reported slightly lower levels of life
satisfaction than usual.</strong> <strong>Similarly, people who wrote
more COVID-19 related posts than usual also reported slightly more
negative affect.</strong> <strong>When writing posts and comments on
social media, people explicitly and more deeply engage with COVID-19
related content.</strong> <strong>Unfortunately, in general online
tonality is often more extreme, negative, or aggressive, which
potentially affects their authors.</strong> <strong>Note that I
controlled for whether or not participants had a COVID-19 infection
during a specific wave, which rules out the potential explanation that
having an infection was the root cause of increased communication and
reduced well-being.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The potential explanation that tonality might be a relevant
factor at play here is also supported by the second trend.</strong>
<strong>People, who during the pandemic spent more time on Instagram
than usual, also experienced less negative affect than usual.</strong>
<strong>Instagram is well-known for its positivity bias <span
class="citation">(Waterloo et al., 2018)</span>.</strong>
<strong>Content is generally post positive, uplifting, and
(self-)flattering.</strong> <strong>It seems the often-criticized
positivity bias on Instagram might have been somewhat beneficial in
times of the pandemic.</strong> <strong>The critique that the positivity
bias necessarily leads to envy and negative feelings is one-sided,
because positive content can also inspire and motivate users <span
class="citation">(Meier et al., 2020)</span>, which could be especially
helpful in times of lockdown and home-office.</strong> <strong>To
provide a concrete example, Instagram was successfully used as an
interactive communication channel for first year students to have a
better start into their new degree, effectively complementing
alternative learning platform tools <span class="citation">(Ye et al.,
2020)</span>.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Similarly, people who spent more time on YouTube than usual
also reported slightly more negative affect than usual.</strong>
<strong>Communication on YouTube is often found to be more negative and
less polite compared to other SNSs <span class="citation">(Halpern &amp;
Gibbs, 2013)</span>.</strong> <strong>YouTube is also routinely linked
to mis- and disinformation.</strong> <strong>Of the 69 most viewed
videos on YouTube on COVID-19, 19 (27.5%) contained nonfactual
information <span class="citation">(Li et al., 2020)</span>.</strong>
<strong>Consuming more negative and misleading information might hence
be a potential explanation for the slightly increased levels of negative
affect.</strong></p>
<p>On the one hand, the results are not aligned with several recent
studies analyzing similar or closely related research questions. This
includes a study by <span class="citation">Bendau et al. (2021)</span>,
which showed negative relations between social media and well-being
<span class="citation">(but see Bradley &amp; Howard, 2021; or Sewall et
al., 2021)</span>. However, note that <span class="citation">Bendau et
al. (2021)</span> analyzed cross-sectional data on a between-person
level while not controlling for third variables, which is not optimal
for investigating causal effects. On the other hand, the results are
well-aligned with <strong>mood management theory <span
class="citation">(Zillmann, 1988)</span></strong> or the uses and
gratifications approach <span class="citation">(Katz et al.,
1973)</span>. If effects were indeed profoundly negative on average,
then people likely wouldn’t spend so much time on social media.
Likewise, recent studies and meta-analyses analyzing the effects of
social media use from a more general perspective or from a somewhat
different angle. These studies have found that the effects of various
types of social media use on several well-being indicators are small at
best, often too small to matter <span class="citation">(Ferguson et al.,
2021; Meier &amp; Reinecke, 2020; Orben, 2020)</span>, which echoes the
results obtained here.</p>
<p><strong>The results showed that it makes sense to analyze different
communication types and communication channels, and that active and
passive communication showed different results.</strong> <strong>Liking
and sharing content did not show any within-person effects. </strong>
<strong>Such rather low-key active behaviors do not seem to affect
well-being at all.</strong> <strong>Regarding passive use, reading
COVID-19 related posts is more ambivalent; results showed some weak
trends towards a positive effect on life satisfaction, but a negative
effect on mood.</strong> <strong>It might be that reading and informing
oneself about COVID-19 on social media might be helpful in the long
term, but more negative for short-term affect.</strong> <strong>Finally,
proactively engaging via writing posts, the most active form of
communication analyzed here, showed only negative effects on
well-being.</strong> <strong>Together, the results support the findings
from <span class="citation">Valkenburg et al. (2022)</span>, who could
not confirm the claim that active use is good, versus passive is
bad.</strong> <strong>Focusing on communication channels, YouTube seems
to be more negative, whereas Instagram is likely more positive.</strong>
<strong>Again, these are only very small effects.</strong>
<strong>Future research might elaborate on these specific relations to
probe their stability and relevance.</strong></p>
<p><strong>From a more political and societal perspective, the results
imply that it can make sense to critically reflect upon COVID-19 related
social media use.</strong> <strong>In terms of concrete recommendations,
on average it might be slightly beneficial to post less actively about
COVID-19 on social media and to spend less time on YouTube.</strong>
<strong>Potential positive effects, however, will for many users likely
not be noticeable.</strong> <strong>Results allow us to reject a
positive effect: Writing more posts on social media will likely not
increase well-being.</strong> <strong>At all events, engaging in COVID
19-related social media use should, on average, not be a cause for
concern.</strong></p>
<!-- First, in terms of media channels, using Twitter more than usual was related to slightly decreased levels of life satisfaction. -->
<!-- Twitter is considered to have more negative affordances and tonality as compared to other networks such as Instagram [@waterlooNormsOnlineExpressions2018], which might help explain the results. -->
<!-- Second, of all the three COVID-19 related social media activities, people who read about the pandemic more than others showed slightly decreased levels of positive affect, and people who actively posted about the pandemic more than others showed slightly increased levels of negative affect. -->
<!-- On the other hand, however, people who posted more about COVID-19 also showed slightly higher levels of positive affects, so taken together the results are ambivalent. -->
<!-- Finally, another interesting observation is that life satisfaction was remarkably stable. -->
<!-- Hence, even in times of a pandemic, it seems that such broad assessment of life vary only mildly. -->
<!-- This supports the hypothesis that life satisfaction seems to be determined largely by stable factors such as one's genes [@brownEasyHappinessPie2019]. -->
<div id="limitations" class="section level2">
<h2>Limitations</h2>
<p>The current study analyzed whether changes in media use were related
to changes in well-being, while controlling for several potential
confounders. Together, this allowed for an improved perspective on
assessing causality. <strong>However, the opposite effect is also
plausible, namely that well-being affects media use <span
class="citation">(Zillmann, 1988)</span>.</strong> <strong>While
controlling for potential confounders can support claims of causality,
the procedure implemented here cannot prove causality.</strong>
Causality necessitates temporal order, and the cause needs to precede
the effect. <strong>The challenge is that</strong> regarding media use,
such effects often happen immediately or shortly after use,
necessitating intervals in the hours, minutes, or even seconds. In many
cases only experience sampling studies asking users at the very moment
can produce such knowledge. However, even then we don’t know for certain
if we actually measured the right interval. Effects depend on the
intensity of use or the length of the interval. To borrow the words from
<span class="citation">Rohrer &amp; Murayama (2021)</span>, there is no
such thing as “the” effect of social media use on well-being. Hence, to
document how effects unfold, future research needs to employ different
study designs probing different time lags. In addition, more thought
needs to be invested in what relevant stable and varying factors we
should include as control variables, and I hope this study provides a
first step into this direction.</p>
<p>Although I had already reduced the predefined SESOIs to be less
conservative, they were potentially still too large. Media use is only
one aspect of several factors that simultaneously affect well-being. Is
it really realistic to expect that extremely changing only <em>one</em>
of these aspects should manifest in a detectable change in well-being?
Or would it make more sense to expect that thoroughly committing to say
<em>two</em> activities (e.g. regularly exercising <em>and</em>
establishing a reading habit) should then cause a detectable improvement
in well-being? Practically, this would imply a SESOI half as large as I
have defined here, namely <em>b</em> = |.15| for well-being and
<em>b</em> = |.075| for affect. In the case of this study, however,
reducing the SESOI would not even make a big difference, as also with
these more liberal thresholds all but three effects would still be
completely in the null region, and no effect would be outside of the
null region. However, at all events I encourage future research to start
a thorough conversation on what effect sizes are considered meaningful
and what not. Again, with this study I hope to provide some first input
and guidelines.</p>
<p>Both media use and well-being were measured using self-reports.
Measuring well-being with self-reports is adequate, because it by
definition requires introspection. However, it would be preferable to
measure social media use objectively, as people cannot reliably estimate
their use <span class="citation">(Scharkow, 2016)</span>. That said,
objective measures often cannot capture the content or the motivation of
the use, and only very complicated tools recording the actual content
(such as the Screenome project) might produce such data. Unfortunately,
such procedures introduce other problems, especially related to privacy.
Hence, for this type of research question it still seems necessary to
use self-reported measures, and in many cases they can still be very
informative <span class="citation">(Verbeij et al., 2021)</span>.</p>
<p>Because the data were collected in a single country, the
generalizability of the results is limited. The results apply primarily
to the more Western sphere, and might not hold true in other cultures,
especially cultures with a different media landscape or alternative
social media channels. That said, because this is a comparatively large
study largely representative of an entire country, and because several
waves were collected across a large time span, the results should be at
least as generalizable as other typical empirical studies collected in
the social sciences.</p>
<!-- Social media use was measured with an ordinal variable, however in the analyses it was treated as a numerical one. -->
<!-- If treated as an ordinal one, it would have been necessary to analyze four different contrasts for each media measure, which plus the differentiation between between and within factor would have produced eight different measures, we would have made the model exceedingly complex. -->
</div>
<div id="conclusion" class="section level2">
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>In this study, COVID-19 related social media use didn’t meaningfully
affect several indicators of well-being, including life satisfaction,
positive affect, and negative affect. <strong>If people wrote more
COVID-19 related posts than usual, or if they spent less time on
Instagram and more time on YouTube, very small but statistically
significant effects were found.</strong> Notably, however, factors other
than social media use were more meaningfully related to well-being, such
as physical health, exercise, satisfaction with democracy, or believing
that one is in control of one’s life. If it’s our aim to improve
well-being <strong>during a pandemic</strong>, it might hence be more
fruitful not to focus so much on social media but to address other, more
pertinent societal problems related to health care, regular exercise, or
a functioning democratic system.</p>

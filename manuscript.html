use on well-being</h1>

<p class="abstract">Abstract</p>
In times of crisis such as the COVID-19 pandemic, citizens need to stay
informed about recent political events. To this end, people increasingly
use social media. However, because social media are particularly
engaging, many find it hard to disconnect, especially during times of
crisis. Using data from the Austrian Corona Panel Project consisting of
3,485 participants from 34 waves, controlling for several stable and
varying confounders, the results showed that COVID-19 related social
media use did not meaningfully reduce well-being. Other factors such as
health, income, exercise, or internal locus of control showed larger and
meaningful effects.
</div>

</div>


<p>During the COVID-19 pandemic it was critical to stay informed
regarding the latest developments. How dangerous is the virus? In what
region is it spreading? How is it transmitted? What are the current
safety regulations? To obtain relevant information, many people heavily
relied on social media, with use being at an all time high <span
class="citation">(Statista 2021)</span>. Some actually could not stop
using social media to learn about COVID-19 related news. A new
phenomenon termed “doomscrolling” emerged <span
class="citation">(Sharma, Lee, and Johnson 2022)</span>. Many users were
glued to their screens and found it hard to pursue other relevant
activities such as working, taking a break, or even looking after their
children. In the media it was hence increasingly asked whether using
social media for COVID-19 related reasons would, next to all other
stressors, create an additional burden on mental health <span
class="citation">(Sandstrom et al. 2021)</span>. Although research has
begun addressing this question <span class="citation">(e.g., Bendau et
al. 2021; Eden et al. 2020; Sewall, Goldstein, and Rosen 2021)</span>,
it still largely unknown if COVID-19 related social media use during the
pandemic has had a meaningful impact on well-being. This study hence
aims to 1) reveal the effect of the different types and channels of
social media use on individual well-being, 2) provide generalizable and
robust results by analyzing a large-scale longitudinal data-set with 34
waves, and 3) determine the within-person causal effects by analyzing
how changes in social media use lead to changes in well-being.</p>
<div id="understanding-well-being-and-media-use" class="section level2">
<h2>Understanding Well-being and Media Use</h2>
<p>This study investigates how different <em>facets</em> of well-being
are affected by different <em>types</em> and different <em>channels</em>
of communication <span class="citation">(Meier and Reinecke
2020)</span>. Building on the typology of subjective well-being <span
class="citation">(Diener, Lucas, and Oishi 2018)</span>, three different
well-being facets are analyzed: life satisfaction, positive affect, and
negative affect. Because effects of social media depend on how they are
used <span class="citation">(Verduyn et al. 2015)</span>, I further
distinguish three types of use and five popular channels. The types of
use include reading, liking and sharing, and posting COVID-19 related
content. In doing so, this study analyzes social media use focused on
COVID-19 related content, which includes posting thoughts about the
pandemic, reading posts and comments, or retweeting and liking COVID-19
related news. Liking and sharing are combined as they both represent
low-threshold, platform-ingrained, easily quantifiable interactions. The
five channels to be investigated are Facebook, Twitter, Instagram,
WhatsApp, and YouTube, which at the time ranked among the most popular
social media services in Austria.</p>
</div>
<div id="social-media-effects-on-well-being" class="section level2">
<h2>Social Media Effects on Well-Being</h2>
<p>How easily can well-being be affected by external influences? In
general, according to the set-point theory, well-being is surprisingly
stable <span class="citation">(Lykken 1999)</span>. Although specific
events such as marriage or salary increase can have significant impacts
on well-being, in most cases effects are short-term, with well-being
after some time returning to prior levels <span
class="citation">(Diener, Lucas, and Oishi 2018)</span>. Specific
factors such as unemployment, disability, or death, however, can cause
long-term changes in well-being <span class="citation">(Lucas
2007)</span>. So although well-being can be affected by external events
and factors, this does not happen easily.</p>
<p>Can social media use be such a factor? Current literature overviews
suggest that social media use on average does seem to decrease
well-being <span class="citation">(Meier and Reinecke 2020)</span>.
However, for most well-being outcomes, such as life satisfaction,
general well-being, or loneliness, the effects are small <span
class="citation">(Meier and Reinecke 2020)</span>. These small findings
can be explained with the differential susceptibility of media effects
model <span class="citation">(Patti M. Valkenburg and Peter
2013)</span>, which states that there is substantial <em>variation</em>
of media effects for individual users. Whereas for some users social
media are more beneficial, for others they are more harmful. On average,
however, and this is central for this study here, effects tend to be
small <span class="citation">(Patti M. Valkenburg and Peter
2013)</span>. For example, in one study it was estimated that roughly
one quarter of all users experienced negative effects, another quarter
positive effects, while for the rest the effects were neutral <span
class="citation">(Beyens et al. 2021)</span>. Whether or not effects are
positive or negative depend on (a) dispositional factors (e.g.,
personality, temperament, gender), (b) developmental factors (e.g., age,
developmental tasks), (c) and social factors (e.g., environment, norms,
upbringing). Finally, effects depend also on the content that is
consumed. If the content is aligned with dispositions, developmental
capacities, and converging contexts, effects tend to be stronger <span
class="citation">(Patti M. Valkenburg and Peter 2013)</span>.</p>
<p>Why are the effects of social media use on well-being small on
average? Two prominent media effect theories argue implicitly against
strong average negative effects. First, according to mood management
theory <span class="citation">(Zillmann 1988)</span>, using media can
affect people’s moods. Use can be stimulating or overwhelming, relaxing
or boring. After some time, users implicitly learn which media help them
balance their mood and affect according to their own situational needs
<span class="citation">(Zillmann 1988)</span>. Those media that
eventually become part of one’s media repertoire hence, on average, tend
to be beneficial for users to regulate their mood <span
class="citation">(Marciano et al. 2022)</span>. In conclusion, if a
certain medium is used frequently, mood-management theory argues that it
is likely not detrimental for well-being.</p>
<p>Second, while mood management theory considers media use mainly
driven by implicit learning experiences, uses and gratifications theory
upholds that the process is more explicit and rational <span
class="citation">(Katz, Blumler, and Gurevitch 1973)</span>. Users
select those media that they expect to have a desired effect, for
example on mood, knowledge, or entertainment. If those beneficial media
effects are missing, people will spend their time elsewhere. And social
media, in general, offer several beneficial effects, explaining why they
are used that much. They help find relevant information, maintain and
foster relationships, express one’s personality, and entertain oneself
<span class="citation">(Pelletier et al. 2020)</span>. In conclusion,
because people spend so much time on social media consuming COVID-19
related content, according to both mood management theory and uses and
gratifications theory this indirectly suggest that average effects on
well-being are likely not particularly negative.</p>
</div>
<div id="social-media-during-covid-19" class="section level2">
<h2>Social Media During COVID-19</h2>
<p>If we look at COVID-19 related use more specifically, how could the
various types and channels of COVID-19 related social media use affect
well-being? Several uses and gratifications exist, which help explain
why people used social media frequently during the pandemic. Despite
incorrect information, social media provide a vast platform for
disseminating <em>accurate and timely information</em> about COVID-19
<span class="citation">(John Hopkins University 2023)</span>. Access to
reliable information can help people make informed decisions, alleviate
uncertainties, and feel empowered during the pandemic. Social media
platforms enable individuals to <em>connect with others</em> who are
experiencing similar challenges during the pandemic <span
class="citation">(Guazzini et al. 2022)</span>. Engaging in online
communities and support groups can provide emotional support and create
a network of like-minded individuals. Many mental health organizations
and professionals utilize social media to share tips, strategies, and
resources for <em>maintaining mental well-being</em> during the pandemic
<span class="citation">(Twitter 2020)</span>. Engaging with such content
might help individuals prioritize their mental health and develop
resilience during challenging times. Social media campaigns and
initiatives can promote <em>positive COVID-19 behaviors</em>, such as
mask-wearing, physical distancing, hand hygiene, and vaccination <span
class="citation">(Athey et al. 2023; Hunt et al. 2022)</span>. Public
health organizations and influencers leverage the power of social media
to spread awareness and encourage responsible actions, contributing to
public health efforts and fostering a sense of collective
responsibility.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the effects might be negative, perhaps best
explained by the following five mechanisms. Social media platforms can
easily spread <em>false or misleading information</em> about COVID-19
<span class="citation">(Li et al. 2020)</span>. Due to the ease of
sharing and the lack of fact-checking, inaccurate information can go
viral and might cause confusion, anxiety, and panic among users.
Constant exposure to COVID-19-related content on social media can lead
to <em>information overload</em> and contribute to heightened anxiety
levels <span class="citation">(J. Fan and Smith 2021)</span>. The rapid
spread of news, updates, and opinions can be overwhelming and might
exacerbate existing stress or fears about the pandemic <span
class="citation">(Sharma, Lee, and Johnson 2022)</span>. Social media
platforms are known for fostering negativity, with users sometimes
engaging in <em>cyberbullying and harassment</em>. Discussions around
COVID-19 can become heated and polarized, leading to personal attacks
and online conflicts. Such experiences threaten mental well-being and
might contribute to feelings of distress and isolation. Social media
often showcase the highlights and accomplishments of others, encouraging
<em>social comparison</em> <span class="citation">(Przybylski et al.
2013)</span>. During a pandemic, seeing posts about others’ successes or
seemingly perfect lives might intensify feelings of inadequacy or FOMO,
especially when individuals are unable to participate in similar
activities due to restrictions or personal circumstances <span
class="citation">(Sharma, Lee, and Johnson 2022)</span>.</p>
<p>There is still little empirical research on how well-being is
affected by social media use that is focused on COVID-19 specifically.
Echoing the theoretical rationales outlines above, studies have yielded
mixed results. Some studies found negative effects, indicating that
excessive social media use for COVID-19 news led to compulsive behavior
and increased stress levels, particularly due to upward social
comparison <span class="citation">(Stainback, Hearne, and Trieu 2020;
Yue, Zhang, and Xiao 2022)</span>. Individuals who relied on social
media as their primary information source reported higher levels of
anxiety and depression symptoms <span class="citation">(Bendau et al.
2021)</span>. Similarly, increased COVID-19-related media consumption
was associated with higher psychological distress. On the other hand,
some studies reported positive outcomes. Certain individuals experienced
increased virtual community and social connectedness during the pandemic
through social media, which contributed to their well-being <span
class="citation">(Guazzini et al. 2022)</span>. Additionally, engaging
more on social media was associated with reduced feelings of loneliness
<span class="citation">(Latikka et al. 2022)</span>. Several studies
reported mostly neutral effects of social media use on well-being
indicators <span class="citation">(Eden et al. 2020; Sewall, Goldstein,
and Rosen 2021)</span>. Overall, the literature demonstrates a mixed
picture, highlighting both positive and negative effects of social media
use focused on or during COVID-19 on well-being.</p>
<!-- It is important to consider individual differences, usage patterns, and other factors that may influence the impact of social media on well-being during this challenging period. -->
<p>In conclusion, given these mixed empirical results, together with the
observation that social media effects on well-being are very small in
general, and that several plausible theoretical mechanisms exist for
both positive and negative effects, I expect that COVID-19 related
communication on social media should not be decidedly positive or
negative. It seems most likely that both positive and negative coexist,
but that on average using social media for COVID-19 related reasons
should not have substantial effects on well-being.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hypothesis: The within-person effects of all measures of COVID-19
related social media use (types: reading, liking and sharing, posting;
channels: Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, YouTube, WhatsApp) on all
measures of well-being indicators (positive affect, negative affect,
life satisfaction)—while controlling for several stable and varying
covariates such as sociodemographic variables and psychological
dispositions (see below)—will be trivial.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div id="smallest-effect-size-of-interest" class="section level2">
<h2>Smallest Effect Size of Interest</h2>
<p>Exploring the hypothesis entails establishing the criteria for
discerning a ‘trivial effect size.’ To achieve this, it is necessary to
define the smallest effect size of interest (SESOI) <span
class="citation">(Anvari and Lakens 2021)</span>. In this context, a
trivial effect should fall below the threshold set by the SESOI
(detailed below). Determining what constitutes a minimally intriguing,
nontrivial effect is a matter with normative implications, making it
challenging to arrive at a definitive, singular consensus. Nonetheless,
it remains both essential and beneficial to strive for a reasonable
benchmark. With that in mind, I propose the following SESOI as a
suitable reference point for this study:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>SESOI: If a heavy user of COVID-19 related social media news suddenly
<em>stops</em> using social media altogether, this should have a
<em>noticeable</em> impact on their overall well-being.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What does this mean practically and how can it be operationalized? In
this study, COVID-19 related social media use was measured on a 5-point
scale, ranging from 1 = <em>never</em> to 5 = <em>several times a
day</em>. Thus, a change of four units in social media use (e.g., a
complete stop) should correspond to a noticeable change in well-being.
According to <span class="citation">Norman, Sloan, and Wyrwich
(2003)</span>, people can reliably notice seven levels of change in
satisfaction with health. So if satisfaction is measured on a 7-point
scale, a four unit change in social media use should result in a one
unit change in life satisfaction. In this study, life satisfaction was
measured on an 11-point scale, and affect on a 5-point scale. Transposed
to this scaling, the SESOI for life satisfaction is <em>b</em> = ±.30,
and for positive and negative affect <em>b</em> = ±.15 (for more
information, see online supplementary material).</p>

<h2>Preregistration</h2>
<p>The hypotheses, the sample, the measures, the analyses, and the
inference criteria (SESOI, <em>p</em>-value) were preregistered on the
Open Science Framework, accessible here: <a

class="uri">https://osf.io/87b24/?view_only=b2289b6fec214fa88ee75a18d45c18f3</a>.
Because in this study I analyze data from an already existing
large-scale data set, the preregistration was done prior to accessing
the data. The preregistration was designed on the basis of the panel
documentation online <span class="citation">(Kittel et al. 2020)</span>.
In some cases, it was impossible to execute the analyses as I had
originally planned, for example because some properties of the variables
only became apparent when seeing the actual data. The most relevant

available here (<a href="https://doi.org/10.11587/28KQNS"
class="uri">https://doi.org/10.11587/28KQNS</a>), and consist of 34
waves. Participants were sampled from a pre-existing online access panel
provided by the company Marketagent, Austria. Panel members were
incentivized with 180 credit points for each wave of the study. The
study was conducted between March 2020 and February 2023. Between March
2020 and July 2020, the intervals between waves were weekly, until May
2022 (wave 32) monthly, and afterward after 5 months. Each wave consists
of at least 1,500 respondents. Panel mortality was compensated through a
continuous re-acquisition of new participants. The sample size was
<em>N</em> = 3,641, with overall 123,794 observations. For an overview

<p>Achieved via quota sampling, the sample matched the Austrian
population in terms of age, gender, region/state, municipality size, and
educational level. In order to participate in the study, the respondents
needed to be Austrian residents and had to be at least 14 years of age.
All respondents needed to have access to the internet (via computer or
mobile devices such as smartphones or tablets). Ethical review and
approval was not required for the study in accordance with the local
legislation and institutional requirements. The participants provided
their written informed consent to participate in this study. The average
age was 40 years, 49 percent were male, 14 percent had a University
degree, and 5 percent were currently unemployed.</p>

<h2>Data Analysis</h2>
<p>The hypothesis is analyzed using the interval testing approach as
proposed by <span class="citation">Dienes (2014)</span>. To illustrate,
let us consider the case of life satisfaction [SESOI: ±.30]. Here, the
null-region lies between -.30 and +.30. If the 95% confidence interval
falls completely within the null-region (e.g., <em>b</em> = -.05, [95%
CI: -.15, .05]), the hypothesis that the effect is trivial is supported.
If the confidence interval falls completely outside of the null-region
(e.g., <em>b</em> = -.40, [95% CI: -.45, -.35]), the hypothesis is
rejected and the existence of a meaningful negative effect is supported.
If the confidence interval and the null region overlap (e.g., <em>b</em>
= -.30, [95% CI: -.35, -.25]), the hypothesis is not supported and the
results are considered inconclusive, while a meaningful positive effect
is rejected. If the confidence interval exceeds both sides of the null
region (e.g., <em>b</em> = -.025, [95% CI: -.40, .35]), the hypothesis
is not supported and judgement is suspended. For an illustration, see
Figure @ref(fig:sesoi).</p>

<div id="causality" class="section level3">
<h3>Causality</h3>
<p>When analyzing causality through longitudinal designs, it is
important to address several critical aspects. An inherent requirement
of analyzing causal effects within non-experimental designs is adopting
an internal perspective, focusing on <em>within-person effects</em>
<span class="citation">(Hamaker 2014)</span>. This entails evaluating
how alterations in an individual’s media consumption directly impact
their well-being. Comparisons between individuals, as observed in
longitudinal data, lack the granularity needed to understand these
causal dynamics <span class="citation">(Hamaker 2014)</span>.
Consequently, this study exclusively investigates within-person effects
to shed light on this intricate relationship.</p>
<p>An essential strategy for isolating the genuine impact of variables
is to <em>control for confounding factors</em> that influence both media
use and well-being <span class="citation">(Rohrer 2018)</span>. In the
context of within-person analysis, this necessitates accounting for
time-varying confounders <span class="citation">(Rohrer and Murayama
2023)</span>. However, a cautious balance must be maintained by not
controlling for variables that mediate the relationship <span
class="citation">(Rohrer 2018)</span>, as their inclusion could distort
the assessment of the causal effect. This study therefore incorporated
several control variables. These encompass gender, age, education, place
of birth and parental place of birth in Austria, Vienna residency,
consumption of text-based and video-based news, household
characteristics, health status, living space features,
employment-related factors, income, outdoor activities, risk propensity,
and locus of control <span class="citation">(Eger and Maridal
2015)</span>. These variables have demonstrated connections with both
social media use and well-being and are not mediators.</p>
<p>A fundamental prerequisite for establishing causality is determining
a <em>plausible temporal interval</em> <span class="citation">(Dormann
and Griffin 2015)</span>. For instance, fluctuations in positive and
negative affect call for shorter intervals, while the more enduring
nature of life satisfaction implies longer intervals <span
class="citation">(Dienlin and Johannes 2020)</span>.</p>
<p>In this study, I examine the linkage between changes in social media
use and changes in affect within the same week. Specifically, I
investigate if heightened COVID-19-related social media use during a
week corresponds with enhanced or diminished affect during that same
week. Additionally, I consider a longer interval for life satisfaction,
examining whether increased COVID-19-related social media use over the
course of a week influences one’s life satisfaction at the week’s end.
This approach aims to uncover whether changes in social media
consumption prompt simultaneous changes in affect and subsequent changes
in life satisfaction.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the study’s main analyses implement this temporal
interval through item wording rather than relying on lagged measures
from previous waves. Supplementary analyses extend this investigation to
observe how media use might affect well-being one or four months later.
In all instances, confounding variables are methodically controlled for,
enhancing the study’s capacity for causal interpretation.</p>
</div>
<div id="statistical-model" class="section level3">
<h3>Statistical model</h3>
<p>The hypothesis was analyzed using random effect within-between models
<span class="citation">(REWB, Bell, Fairbrother, and Jones 2019)</span>.
Altogether three models were run, one for each dependent variable. The
data were hierarchical, and responses were separately nested in
participants and waves (i.e., participants and waves were implemented as
random effects). Nesting in participants accounts for the longitudinal
design. Nesting in waves controls for general exogenous developments,
such as general decreases in well-being in the population, for example
due to lockdown measures. Thus, there was no need additionally to
control for specific phases or measures of the lockdown. Predictors were
modeled as fixed effects. They included social media communication types
and channels, separated into within and between-person factors, as well
as stable and varying covariates. Between-person predictors are the
predictors centered on the grand mean; within-person predictors are the
predictors centered on the person’s mean. Between-person predictors
(which, measuring relations, are not of particular interest in this
study) represent how the mean of one respondent differs from the mean of
all the other respondents. The within-person predictors represent how
much a person at one specific wave differs from their own mean. For
example, we could find that on Wave 3 a person used social media more
than usual, while also experiencing more negative affect than usual. All
predictors were included simultaneously in each of the three models.</p>
<p>The factorial validity of the scales were tested with confirmatory
factor analyses (CFA). Because Mardia’s test showed that the assumption
of multivariate normality was violated, I used the more robust
Satorra-Bentler scaled and mean-adjusted test statistic (MLM) as
estimator. Mean scores were used for positive and negative affect.
Missing responses were imputed using multiple imputation with predictive
mean matching (five iterations, 30 data-sets), including categorical
variables. All variables were imputed except the social media use
measures, as they were not collected on each wave. All variables
included in the analyses presented here were used to impute missing
data. For the main analyses, results were pooled across all thirty
data-sets.</p>
<p>To contextualize the results, I conducted additional exploratory
analyses. I reran the analyses (a) with additional not-preregistered
covariates such as trust in media or government, (b) without covariates,
(c) with single imputation, and (d) without imputation. For more

<div id="covid-19-related-social-media-use" class="section level3">
<h3>COVID-19 related social media use</h3>
<p>COVID-19 related social media use focused on communication types was
measured with the three dimensions of (a) reading, (b) liking and
sharing, and (c) posting. The items come from <span
class="citation">Wagner et al. (2018)</span> and were adapted for the
context of this study. The general introductory question was “How often
during the last week have you engaged in the following activities on
social media?”. The three items were “Reading the posts of others with
content on the Coronavirus”, “When seeing posts on the Coronavirus, I
clicked ‘like’, ‘share’ or ‘retweet’”, “I myself wrote posts on the
Coronavirus on social media.” Answer options were 1 (<em>several times
per day</em>), 2 (<em>daily</em>), 3 (<em>several times per week</em>),
4 (<em>weekly</em>), 5 (<em>never</em>). The items were inverted for the
analyses.</p>
<p>COVID-19 related social media use focused on channels was measured
with five variables from <span class="citation">Wagner et al.
(2018)</span>, adapted for this study. The general introductory question
was “How often in the last week have you followed information related to
the Corona-crisis on the following social media?” The five items were
(a) Facebook, (b) Twitter, (c) Instagram, (d) Youtube, and (e) WhatsApp.
Again, the answer options were 1 (<em>several times per day</em>), 2
(<em>daily</em>), 3 (<em>several times per week</em>), 4
(<em>weekly</em>), 5 (<em>never</em>). Again, the items were inverted
for the analyses.</p>
<p>Social media use was measured for all participants on waves 1, 2, 8,
17, 23, and 28 (see Figure 1). Freshly recruited respondents always
answered all questions on COVID 19-related social media use. Because new
respondents always provided data on media use, it was possible to
include these data into the analyses. Hence, for the main analyses data
from all 34 waves were used. In the additional analyses I tested longer
intervals, namely if changes in social media use were associated with
changes in well-being either one month of four months later. For these
analyzes I used the predictors from waves 1, 2, 8, 17, 23, and 28, to
see if they predicted changes in well-being either one month or four
months later.</p>
</div>
<div id="control-variables" class="section level3">
<h3>Control variables</h3>
<p>The effects of COVID-19 related social media use were controlled for
the following stable variables: gender (female, male, diverse), age,
education (ten options), Austria country of birth (yes/no), Austria
parents’ country of birth (no parent, one parent, both parents), and
household size. I also controlled for the following varying covariates:
five items on current living conditions, including self-reported
physical health, whether participants contracted COVID-19 since the last
wave, current household income, working in home-office, and overall work
hours; nine items measuring use of specific national text-based and
video-based news outlets; five items measuring outdoor activities such
as exercise or meeting friends; and two more psychological measures

<h2>Descriptive Analyses</h2>
<p>Looking at the variables from a descriptive perspective, aligned with
set-point theory we can see that the level of all well-being measures
were surprisingly stable during data collection (see Figure
@ref(fig:fig-descriptives)). COVID-19 related social media use, however,
showed changes. Reading, sharing and liking COVID-19 related content
decreased substantially (almost one scale point from 3 to 2). Posting
about COVID-19 related content stayed the same. Using Facebook and
WhatsApp for COVID-19 related content decreased. Instagram, YouTube, and
Twitter stayed the same. The general initial decrease could be explained
by the fact that the collection of data began at the end of March 2020,
hence approximately three months after the pandemic’s onset. After an
initial uptick, COVID-19 related social media use might have already
been declining at the time.</p>

</div>
<p>Using the average values across all waves, which provides a stable
picture of the general relations, I next looked at the correlations
between social media use and well-being (see Figure
@ref(fig:fig-correlations)). Several interesting patterns emerged. In
general, people who spend more time engaging with COVID-19 related
content on social media reported reduced well-being. Users who spend
more time reading, liking and sharing, and posting COVID-19 related
content were less satisfied with their lives. They also showed slightly
less positive affect. This overall negative picture was even more
pronounced for negative affect. People who engaged more with COVID-19
related content, including all types and channels of communication,
reported substantially higher levels of negative affect. For example,
people who were more likely to post COVID-19 content had much higher
levels of negative affect (<em>r</em> = .61). Note that these results
represent between-person correlations, not causal within-person
effects.</p>

<div id="preregistered-analyses" class="section level2">
<h2>Preregistered Analyses</h2>
<p>The study’s main hypothesis was that the causal effects of all types
and channels of social media use on all facets of well-being would be
trivial. Regarding the effects of different <em>communication types</em>
(i.e., reading, sharing, of posting about COVID-19 related content), all
within-person effects fell completely within the a-priori defined null
region (see Figure @ref(fig:fig-within)). For example, respondents who
used social media more frequently than usual to like or share COVID-19
related content did not show a simultaneous change in life satisfaction
(<em>b</em> = -0.02 [95% CI -0.06, 0.01]). As a result, the hypothesis
of trivial effects was supported for all COVID-19 related types of
social media communication.</p>
<p>However, several effects stood out, as statistically they were
significantly different from zero. Users who read more COVID-19 related
content than usual reported slightly reduced levels of positive affect
(<em>b</em> = -0.03 [95% CI -0.05, -0.02]). Users who liked and shared
more COVID-19 related content than usual also experienced slightly more
negative affect than usual (<em>b</em> = 0.05 [95% CI 0.04, 0.07]).
Posting COVID-19 related content affected all types of well-being. Users
who wrote more COVID-19 related posts than usual also reported slightly
less life satisfaction than usual (<em>b</em> = -0.04 [95% CI -0.08,
-0.01]) and slightly more negative affect than usual (<em>b</em> = 0.05
[95% CI 0.04, 0.07]). Interestingly, however, users who wrote more
COVID-19 related posts than usual also experienced slightly
<em>higher</em> levels of positive affect than usual (<em>b</em> = 0.02
[95% CI 0.01, 0.04]).</p>
<p>Regarding the COVID-19 related use of <em>social media channels</em>
(i.e., Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, YouTube, and Twitter) the results
were comparable (see Figure @ref(fig:fig-within)). Changes in the
frequency of using different social media channels to attain information
regarding COVID-19 were unrelated to meaningful changes in well-being.
For example, respondents who used Facebook more frequently than usual to
learn about COVID-19 did not show a simultaneous change in life
satisfaction (<em>b</em> -0.01 [95% CI -0.04, 0.02]). In sum, the
hypothesis of trivial effects was supported also for the COVID-19
related use of important social media channels.</p>
<p>That said, two effects differed statistically from zero. Respondents
who used Twitter more frequently than usual to attain COVID-19 related
news reported slightly higher levels of negative affect than usual
(<em>b</em> = 0.02 [95% CI 0.01, 0.04]). Likewise, respondents who used
YouTube more frequently than usual for COVID-19 related issues reported
slightly higher levels of negative affect than usual (<em>b</em> = 0.01
[95% CI &lt; 0.01, 0.02]). However, both effects were still completely
inside of the null region, hence likely not large enough to be
considered meaningful.</p>
<p>For an overview of all within-person effects, see Figure
@ref(fig:fig-within).</p>
<div class="figure">

<div id="exploratory-analyses" class="section level2">
<h2>Exploratory Analyses</h2>
<p>To contextualize the results reported above and to see if the study
included any meaningful effects at all, I also looked at the effect
sizes of the covariates. Because each variable featured different
response options, which would require defining a SESOI for each
variable, I hence report the results of the standardized scales, which
allows for a better comparison across the differently scaled variables.
Here, we can build on Cohen’s convention that small effects begin at
<em>r</em> = |.10|.</p>
<p>The results showed that several effects crossed or fell completely
outside of the SESOI, and can hence be considered meaningful. For
example, if physical health decreased, this had a meaningful detrimental
impact on life satisfaction (<span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span>
= .19 [95% CI .18, .20]), positive affect (<span
class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> = .18 [95% CI .17, .19]), and
negative affect (<span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> = -.19 [95%
CI -.20, -.18]). Spending more time outside to exercise meaningfully
increased positive affect (<span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> =
.12 [95% CI .11, .14]). The strongest aspect affecting well-being was
internal locus of control. If people felt more in control of their
lives, this strongly increased both life satisfaction (<span
class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> = .33 [95% CI .31, .35]) and
positive affect (<span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> = .28 [95%
CI .27, .30]), while decreasing negative affect (<span
class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> = -.29 [95% CI -.31, -.27]). For an
overview, see Figure @ref(fig:fig-control).</p>

<p class="caption">

</div>
<p>Because life satisfaction is more stable than affect, the effects of
communication might materialize some time later. I hence also tested the
effects across the longer intervals of one month and four months.
Results showed that all effects disappeared. No effect remained
significant, implying that at least in this case in this case effects
take place on a shorter interval.</p>
<p>Finally, as suggested by the differential susceptibility of media
effects model, media effects can depend on dispositional factors,
developmental stages, or cultural norms <span class="citation">(Patti M.
Valkenburg and Peter 2013)</span>, such as gender and age <span
class="citation">(Orben et al. 2022)</span>. I hence reran the analyses,
differentiating effects for boys and girls and for age cohorts. The
results showed that effects did not differ across genders. The effects
also did not depend on age. However, one effect stood out and was
significant. Compared to the middle age category Generation X, results
showed that if users from Generation Z posted more COVID-19 content than
usual this lead to significantly more negative affect (<span
class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> = .04 [95% CI .01, .06]).</p>

<div id="discussion" class="section level1">
<h1>Discussion</h1>
<p>This study, based on a representative panel study spanning 34 waves
within the Austrian population, investigated the impact of
COVID-19-related social media usage on well-being. The between-person
correlations revealed that increased engagement with COVID-19 content on
social media was associated with decreased well-being. For instance,
individuals consuming more COVID-19-related content reported slightly
lower life satisfaction, somewhat reduced positive affect, and notably
elevated negative affect compared to others. However, to explore if
these between-person correlations translated into within-person effects,
it was examined whether within-person changes in media consumption
corresponded with within-person changes in well-being.</p>
<p>Contrary to expectations, increased consumption of COVID-19 content
did not significantly decrease well-being at a meaningful level. While
several statistically significant effects emerged, their magnitudes were
notably small. For instance, reading more COVID-19 posts than usual
slightly decreased positive affect. Liking and sharing more COVID-19
content than usual were associated with slightly higher negative affect.
Posting more COVID-19 content reduced life satisfaction slightly while
elevating both positive and negative affect. The effects, although
statistically significant, fell within a predefined range considered
insignificant.</p>
<p>Further analysis demonstrated that factors such as health and
physical activity, which would be expected to have substantial impacts
on well-being, indeed showed significant influences. Additionally,
extended assessments covering one and four months did not yield
meaningful effects. In summary, the influence of COVID-19-related social
media activity on well-being was not substantial. This counters popular
concerns over excessive social media use during crises causing
substantial well-being risks.</p>
<p>That said, there is no consensus among scholars as to when effects
become practically relevant and meaningful. If we adopt a more liberal
and cautious perspective, the study indicates a tendency for
COVID-19-related social media usage to impact well-being negatively more
frequently than positively. Notably several statistically significant
negative effects were observed, contrasting with a single positive
effect. Hence, although effects were overall very small, the trend was
for effects to be negative.</p>
<p>These results align with prior research highlighting that social
media usage is rather associated with elevated negative affect but not
reduced life satisfaction <span class="citation">(Meier and Reinecke
2020)</span>. The often extreme, negative, or aggressive tone of
COVID-19 discussions on social media <span class="citation">(L. Fan, Yu,
and Yin 2020)</span> could adversely impact more active authors. The
negative effects may be explained by the consumption of negative and
misleading information <span class="citation">(Li et al.
2020)</span>.</p>
<p>Moreover, the study suggest that varying communication types and
channels warrant separate analyses. Reading COVID-19 related content
slightly reduced positive affect, while liking, sharing, and posting
increased negative affect slightly. Posting COVID-19-related comments
increased both negative and positive affect slightly, while it reduced
life satisfaction. This suggests that posting generates stronger
reactions, both positive and negative. Together, this challenges the
assumption that active use is inherently beneficial and passive use
detrimental <span class="citation">(Patti M. Valkenburg, van Driel, and
Beyens 2022)</span>. Notably, communication channels exhibited
differences. Twitter and YouTube appeared more negative, whereas
Instagram, WhatsApp, and Facebook were neutral.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the study aligns with theoretical models and past
research. It supports the notion of social media effects being small and
contingent on communication type and channel <span
class="citation">(Meier and Reinecke 2020; Patti M. Valkenburg and Peter
2013)</span>. Posting COVID-19 content was more negative for Generation
Z, potentially reflecting broader negative effects of social media on
this generation. Effects not being strongly negative also help explain
why people spent so much time engaging with COVID-19 content on social
media <span class="citation">(Katz, Blumler, and Gurevitch 1973;
Zillmann 1988)</span>.</p>
<p>Several limitations exist. While the study’s focus on within-person
effects enhances causal understanding, challenges exist related to
additional relevant confounding variables not included here <span
class="citation">(Rohrer 2018)</span>, correct definition of the SESOI
<span class="citation">(Anvari and Lakens 2021)</span>, and exact
measurement of media use <span class="citation">(Scharkow 2016)</span>.
The study’s results are applicable primarily to Western societies and
may not hold true in different cultural contexts.</p>
<p>The study’s findings conclude that COVID-19-related social media
activity minimally affects well-being, with other factors playing more
substantial roles. In light of these minimal effects, concerns over
COVID-19-related social media engagement on well-being appear to be
unwarranted. When trying to improve well-being during a pandemic,
instead of focusing on social media it seems more fruitful to address
other, more pertinent societal problems related to health care, regular
exercise, or psychological resilience.</p>

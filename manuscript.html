use on well-being</h1>
<h4 class="author">Name blinded for review</h4>

<p class="abstract">Abstract</p>
In times of crisis such as the COVID-19 pandemic, citizens need to stay
informed about recent political events. To this end, people increasingly
use social media. However, because social media are particularly
engaging, many find it hard to disconnect, especially during times of
crisis. Using data from the Austrian Corona Panel Project consisting of
3,485 participants from 34 waves, controlling for several stable and
varying confounders, the results showed that COVID-19 related social
media use did not meaningfully reduce well-being. Other factors such as
health, income, exercise, or internal locus of control showed larger and
meaningful effects.
</div>

</div>


<p>During the COVID-19 pandemic it was critical to stay informed
regarding the latest developments. How dangerous is the virus? In what
region is it spreading? How is it transmitted? What are the current
safety regulations? To obtain relevant information, many people heavily
relied on social media, with use being at an all time high <span
class="citation">(Statista 2021)</span>. Some actually could not stop
using social media to learn about COVID-19 related news. A new
phenomenon termed “doomscrolling” emerged <span
class="citation">(Sharma, Lee, and Johnson 2022)</span>. Many users were
glued to their screens and found it hard to pursue other relevant
activities such as working, taking a break, or even looking after their
children <span class="citation">(Klein 2021)</span>. In the media it was
hence increasingly asked whether using social media for COVID-19 related
reasons would, next to all other stressors, create an additional burden
on mental health <span class="citation">(Sandstrom et al. 2021)</span>.
Although research has begun addressing this question <span
class="citation">(e.g., Bendau et al. 2021; Eden et al. 2020; Sewall,
Goldstein, and Rosen 2021)</span>,
<!-- [@bendauAssociationsCOVID19Related2021; @bradleyStressMoodSmartphone2021; @choiMediatedCommunicationMatters2021; @dornemannHowGoodBad2021; @edenMediaCopingCOVID192020; @guazziniSecondWaveAnalysis2022; @latikkaLonelinessPsychologicalDistress2022; @liuRelationOfficialWhatsAppdistributed2020; @riehmAssociationsMediaExposure2020; @sewallObjectivelyMeasuredDigital2021; @stainbackCOVID1924News2020; @yuePassiveSocialMedia2022] -->
it still largely unknown if COVID-19 related social media use during the
pandemic has had a meaningful impact on well-being. This study hence
aims to 1) reveal the effect of the different types and channels of
social media use on individual well-being, 2) provide generalizable and
robust results by analyzing a large-scale longitudinal data-set with 34
waves, and 3) determine the within-person causal effects by analyzing
how changes in social media use lead to changes in well-being.</p>
<div id="understanding-well-being-and-media-use" class="section level2">
<h2>Understanding Well-being and Media Use</h2>
<!-- Two underlying theories guided the selection of variables for this study, namely the two-continua model of mental health [@greenspoonIntegrationSubjectiveWellbeing2001] and the hierarchical taxonomy of computer-mediated communication [@meierComputermediatedCommunicationSocial2020a]. -->
<!-- According to the two-continua model, mental health consists of (a) psychopathology and (b) well-being. -->
<!-- <!-- Because the aim of this study is better to understand typical users and everyday contexts, my focus will be on well-being. -->
<!-- Well-being can be differentiated into subjective and psychological well-being [@dienerAdvancesOpenQuestions2018]. -->
<!-- Whereas subjective well-being emphasizes hedonic aspects such as happiness and joy, psychological well-being addresses eudaimonic aspects such as fulfillment and meaning. -->
<!-- Subjective well-being is primarily about achieving positive and avoiding negative affect. -->
<!-- One of the most prominent indicators of well-being is life satisfaction. -->
<!-- In my view, because it represents a general appraisal of one's life, life satisfaction is best thought of as a meta concept combining psychological and subjective well-being. -->
<!-- Notably, life satisfaction is stable and fluctuates only little, whereas it's the exact opposite for affect [@dienlinImpactDigitalTechnology2020]. -->
<!-- <!-- Everyone can feel bad on any given day, but whether or not one feels generally comfortable in one's life rather changes across years. -->
<!-- To capture well-being in this study I thus build on life satisfaction, positive affect, and negative affect. -->
<!-- Together, this should provide an encompassing perspective on potential media effects. -->
<!-- The hierarchical taxonomy of computer-mediated communication differentiates six levels of how people engage with digital technology. -->
<!-- First, the device (e.g., smartphone); second, the type of application (e.g., social networking site); third, the branded application (e.g., Twitter); fourth, the feature (e.g., status post); fifth, the interaction (e.g., one-to-many); and sixth, the message (e.g., content) [@meierComputermediatedCommunicationSocial2020a]. -->
<!-- Whereas the first four levels focus on the communication _channel_, the last two address the communication _type_. -->
<!-- Distinguishing different communication channels and communication types is important, because the effects on well-being likely differ across communication channels and communication types. -->
<!-- Whereas active social media use such as chatting is routinely linked to improved well-being, passive use such as reading is often considered more negative [@dienlinImpactDigitalTechnology2020]. -->
<!-- Similarly, branded apps are separate communication entities with potentially divergent effects and affordances. -->
<!-- For example, @waterlooNormsOnlineExpressions2018 found that it's more adequate to express negative emotions on WhatsApp than on Twitter or on Instagram. -->
<!-- Especially during a pandemic, it makes sense to analyze if users engage with COVID-19 related content on Instagram, where communication is more positive, or on Facebook, where communication is more critical. -->
<!-- First studies suggest that during the pandemic Instagram use was indeed more beneficial for well-being than Facebook use [@masciantonioDonPutAll2021]. -->
<!-- In this study, to measure the effects of social media use focused on COVID-19 related news and topics, I adopt both the channel and the type of communication perspective. -->
<!-- Together, this should offer a nuanced and comprehensive understanding of communication. -->
<p>This study investigates how different <em>facets</em> of well-being
are affected by different <em>types</em> and different <em>channels</em>
of communication <span class="citation">(Meier and Reinecke
2020)</span>.
<!-- , namely active and passive use [@ellisonWhyWeDon2020; @meierComputermediatedCommunicationSocial2020a]. -->
<!-- Defining what constitutes active and what passive use is not always clear, and different understandings are currently discussed [@ellisonWhyWeDon2020; @meierComputermediatedCommunicationSocial2020a]. -->
<!-- Reading is generally considered as passive and writing as active use, while there are also specific behaviors falling somewhere in-between such as liking or sharing content [@meierDoesPassiveSocial2022]. -->
<!-- In this study,  --> Building on the typology of subjective
well-being <span class="citation">(Diener, Lucas, and Oishi
2018)</span>, three different well-being facets are analyzed: life
satisfaction, positive affect, and negative affect. Because effects of
social media depend on how they are used <span class="citation">(Verduyn
et al. 2015)</span>, I further distinguish three types of use and five
popular channels. The types of use include reading, liking and sharing,
and posting COVID-19 related content. In doing so, this study analyzes
social media use focused on COVID-19 related content, which includes
posting thoughts about the pandemic, reading posts and comments, or
retweeting and liking COVID-19 related news. Liking and sharing are
combined as they both represent low-threshold, platform-ingrained,
easily quantifiable interactions. The five channels to be investigated
are Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, WhatsApp, and YouTube, which at the
time ranked among the most popular social media services in Austria.</p>

<div id="social-media-effects-on-well-being" class="section level2">
<h2>Social Media Effects on Well-Being</h2>
<!-- <!-- In conclusion, most effects are likely somewhere between trivial and small. -->
<!-- <!-- I therefore expect that also in the case of COVID-19 related social media use effects will be trivial to small. -->
<!-- In what follows, I outline potential arguments as to why the effect might be positive or negative, direct or indirect, or nonexistent. -->
<p>How easily can well-being be affected by external influences? In
general, according to the set-point theory, well-being is surprisingly
stable <span class="citation">(Lykken 1999)</span>. Although specific
events such as marriage or salary increase can have significant impacts
on well-being, in most cases effects are only short-term, with
well-being after some time returning to prior levels <span
class="citation">(Sheldon and Lucas 2014)</span>. Only very specific
factors such as unemployment, disability, or death can cause long-term
changes in well-being <span class="citation">(Lucas 2007)</span>. So
although well-being can be affected by external events and factors, this
does not happen easily.
<!-- Although the set-point theory has been criticized lately because events such as marriage, unemployment, or death can indeed lead to long-term changes, it is still widely maintained that well-being is very stable and hence hard to be influenced  --></p>
<p>Can social media use be such a factor? Current literature overviews
suggest that social media use on average does seem to decrease
well-being <span class="citation">(Meier and Reinecke 2020)</span>.
However, for most well-being outcomes, such as life satisfaction,
general well-being, or loneliness, the effects are small <span
class="citation">(Meier and Reinecke 2020)</span>. These small findings
can be explained with the differential susceptibility of media effects
model <span class="citation">(Patti M. Valkenburg and Peter
2013)</span>, which states that there is substantial <em>variation</em>
of media effects for individual users. Whereas for some users social
media are more beneficial, for others they are more harmful. On average,
however, and this is central for this study here, effects tend to be
small <span class="citation">(Patti M. Valkenburg and Peter
2013)</span>. For example, in one study it was estimated that roughly
one quarter of all users experienced negative effects, another quarter
positive effects, while for the rest the effects were neutral <span
class="citation">(Beyens et al. 2021)</span>. Whether or not effects are
positive or negative depend on (a) dispositional factors (e.g.,
personality, temperament, gender), (b) developmental factors (e.g., age,
developmental tasks), (c) and social factors (e.g., environment, norms,
upbringing). Finally, effects depend also on the content that is
consumed. If the content is aligned with dispositions, developmental
capacities, and converging contexts, effects tend to be stronger <span
class="citation">(Patti M. Valkenburg and Peter 2013)</span>.</p>
<p>Why are the effects of social media use on well-being small on
average? Two prominent media effect theories argue implicitly against
strong average negative effects. First, according to mood management
theory <span class="citation">(Zillmann 1988)</span>, using media can
affect people’s moods. Use can be stimulating or overwhelming, relaxing
or boring. After some time, users implicitly learn which media help them
balance their mood and affect according to their own situational needs
<span class="citation">(Zillmann 1988)</span>. Those media that
eventually become part of one’s media repertoire hence, on average, tend
to be beneficial for users to regulate their mood <span
class="citation">(Marciano et al. 2022)</span>. In conclusion, if a
certain medium is used frequently, mood-management theory argues that it
is likely not detrimental for well-being.
<!-- For example, using experience sampling of well-being and logs of social media use, a study with 82 participants from Italy found that after episodes of social media use, levels of positive affect increased significantly [@marcianoDynamicsAdolescentsSmartphone2022]. -->
On the other hand, although mood management theory suggests that effects
should not be overly negative, it could be that although short-term
effects are positive, long-term effects are negative.
<!-- it is still possible that people misjudge media effects. -->
<!-- Users are often overly optimistic [@metzgerComparativeOptimismPrivacy2017], focusing on short term benefits while ignoring long-term costs.  -->
Precisely because social media have so many positive consequences in the
short run, this might cause problem in the long run—for example, because
social media use displaces other potentially more meaningful and/or
relaxing activities <span class="citation">(Hall and Liu 2022)</span>.
<!-- In other words, social media might not problematic because they are inherently bad, but rather because they are too good. -->
As with many other things, there can be too much of a good thing. It is
therefore often asked whether social media can become addictive, and
users sometimes express this fear themselves <span
class="citation">(Yang et al. 2021)</span>.
<!-- However, a recently published meta-analysis found that the two most prominent measures of addiction, the Bergen Facebook Addiction Scale and the Bergen Social Media Addiction Scale, have only small relations to well-being [@duradoniWellbeingSocialMedia2020]. -->
<!-- In addition, the general idea of labeling excessive social and new media use as addiction was criticized, arguing that social media use represent a new regular behavior that should not be pathologized [@galerHowMuchToo2018; @vanrooijWeakScientificBasis2018]. -->
<!-- In conclusion, there are several plausible theoretical mechanisms as to why effects might be negative or positive, explaining why on average effects might not be particularly negative or positive. --></p>
<p>Second, while mood management theory considers media use mainly
driven by implicit learning experiences, uses and gratifications theory
upholds that the process is more explicit and rational <span
class="citation">(Katz, Blumler, and Gurevitch 1973)</span>. Users
select those media that they expect to have a desired effect, for
example on mood, knowledge, or entertainment. If those beneficial media
effects are missing, people will spend their time elsewhere. And social
media, in general, offer several beneficial effects, explaining why they
are used that much. They help find relevant information, maintain and
foster relationships, express one’s personality, and entertain oneself
<span class="citation">(Pelletier et al. 2020)</span>. In conclusion,
because people spend so much time on social media consuming COVID-19
related content, according to both mood management theory and uses and
gratifications theory this indirectly suggest that average effects on
well-being are likely not particularly negative.</p>

<h2>Social Media During COVID-19</h2>
<p>If we look at COVID-19 related use more specifically, how could the
various types and channels of COVID-19 related social media use affect
well-being? Several uses and gratifications exist, which help explain
why people used social media frequently during the pandemic.
<!-- , outlining mechanisms of potential positive effects.  -->
<!-- At the same time, there are also several plausible reasons as to why COVID-19 related social media use is beneficial for well-being. -->
<!-- Access to information and resources:  --> Despite incorrect
information, social media provide a vast platform for disseminating
<em>accurate and timely information</em> about COVID-19 <span
class="citation">(John Hopkins University 2023)</span>.
<!-- It allows individuals to stay informed about the latest updates, guidelines, and recommendations from reputable health organizations and experts.  -->
Access to reliable information can help people make informed decisions,
alleviate uncertainties, and feel empowered during the pandemic.
<!-- Educational opportunities:  --> Social media can be a valuable
<em>educational tool</em>, with various organizations and experts
sharing informative content about COVID-19 <span class="citation">(World
Health Organization 2023)</span>.
<!-- This can include explanatory videos, infographics, and articles that help individuals understand the virus, its transmission, prevention strategies, and vaccination information.  -->
Access to educational resources on social media can empower individuals
to make informed decisions regarding their health.
<!-- Community support and solidarity:  --> Social media platforms
enable individuals to <em>connect with others</em> who are experiencing
similar challenges during the pandemic <span class="citation">(Guazzini
et al. 2022)</span>.
<!-- Sharing experiences, offering support, and expressing solidarity can foster a sense of community and reduce feelings of isolation.  -->
Engaging in online communities and support groups can provide emotional
support and create a network of like-minded individuals.
<!-- Promoting mental health and well-being:  --> Many mental health
organizations and professionals utilize social media to share tips,
strategies, and resources for <em>maintaining mental well-being</em>
during the pandemic <span class="citation">(Twitter 2020)</span>.
<!-- They provide guidance on coping mechanisms, stress reduction techniques, and self-care practices.  -->
Engaging with such content might help individuals prioritize their
mental health and develop resilience during challenging times.
<!-- Encouraging positive behaviors:  --> Social media campaigns and
initiatives can promote <em>positive COVID-19 behaviors</em>, such as
mask-wearing, physical distancing, hand hygiene, and vaccination <span
class="citation">(Athey et al. 2023; Hunt et al. 2022)</span>. Public
health organizations and influencers leverage the power of social media
to spread awareness and encourage responsible actions, contributing to
public health efforts and fostering a sense of collective
responsibility. <!-- Amplifying diverse voices and perspectives:  -->
<!-- Social media platforms provide a space for diverse voices and perspectives to be heard [@brunsAreFilterBubbles2019].  -->
<!-- This allows individuals to access a range of viewpoints, experiences, and cultural practices related to COVID-19.  -->
<!-- Exposure to diverse perspectives might promote empathy, understanding, and a more comprehensive understanding of the pandemic's impact on different communities. --></p>
<p>On the other hand, the effects might be negative, perhaps best
explained by the following five mechanisms.
<!-- Misinformation and rumors:  --> Social media platforms can easily
spread <em>false or misleading information</em> about COVID-19 <span
class="citation">(Li et al. 2020)</span>. Due to the ease of sharing and
the lack of fact-checking, inaccurate information can go viral and might
cause confusion, anxiety, and panic among users.
<!-- Overwhelm and anxiety:  --> Constant exposure to COVID-19-related
content on social media can lead to <em>information overload</em> and
contribute to heightened anxiety levels <span class="citation">(J. Fan
and Smith 2021)</span>. The rapid spread of news, updates, and opinions
can be overwhelming and might exacerbate existing stress or fears about
the pandemic <span class="citation">(Sharma, Lee, and Johnson
2022)</span>. <!-- Confirmation bias and echo chambers:  --> Social
media algorithms are designed to show users content that aligns with
their interests and beliefs, potentially contributing to <em>echo
chambers</em> <span class="citation">(Cinelli et al. 2021)</span>.
<!-- This might lead to confirmation bias, where individuals are more likely to be exposed to information that confirms their preexisting beliefs.  -->
In the context of COVID-19, this might reinforce false or misleading
information and prevent individuals from considering alternative
perspectives. <!-- Cyberbullying and harassment:  --> Social media
platforms are known for fostering negativity, with users sometimes
engaging in <em>cyberbullying and harassment</em> <span

<!-- Reduced face-to-face interaction:  -->
<!-- Spending excessive time on social media to learn about COVID-19 can lead to a decrease in face-to-face interactions and real-life connections [but see @hallSocialMediaUse2022].  -->
<!-- This might impact mental health, as most humans have an innate need for social support and physical presence, which online interactions might not fully replicate. --></p>
<!-- Using Social media is ambivalent. -->
<!-- It can impair well-being when causing embarrassment, stress, or disinformation, and it can improve well-being when providing connectedness, information, or entertainment [@buchiDigitalWellbeingTheory2021]. -->
<!-- Although social media are often associated with negative outcomes, there are a large number of positive effects, which either offset or at least significantly reduce negative outcomes. -->
<!-- Positive outcomes encompass finding relevant information; maintaining and fostering relationships; expressing one's personality; or entertaining oneself [e.g., @pelletierOneSizeDoesn2020]. -->
<!-- Negative effects include distraction; displacement of other meaningful activities; consumption of shallow, misleading or challenging content; or negative social comparisons [e.g., @meierDoesPassiveSocial2022]. -->
<!-- People are much more likely to use media that offer plentiful benefits [@katzUsesGratificationsResearch1973]. -->
<!-- Users implicitly learn what media help them regulate their mood and thereby well-being [@zillmannMoodManagementCommunication1988]. -->
<!-- Given the ubiquitous use of social media, the many benefits they offer, plus the general and implicit competence to use media that foster mood management, it is hence unlikely that the effects of social media use on well-being are profusely negative. -->
<!-- As outline above,   -->
<p>There is still little empirical research on how well-being is
affected by social media use that is focused on COVID-19 specifically.
Echoing the theoretical rationales outlines above, studies have yielded
mixed results. Some studies found negative effects, indicating that
excessive social media use for COVID-19 news led to compulsive behavior
and increased stress levels, particularly due to upward social
comparison <span class="citation">(Klein 2021; Stainback, Hearne, and
Trieu 2020; Yue, Zhang, and Xiao 2022)</span>. Individuals who relied on
social media as their primary information source reported higher levels
of anxiety and depression symptoms <span class="citation">(Bendau et al.
2021)</span>. Similarly, increased COVID-19-related media consumption
was associated with higher psychological distress. On the other hand,
some studies reported positive outcomes. Certain individuals experienced
increased virtual community and social connectedness during the pandemic
through social media, which contributed to their well-being <span
class="citation">(Guazzini et al. 2022)</span>. Additionally, engaging
more on social media was associated with reduced feelings of loneliness
<span class="citation">(Latikka et al. 2022)</span>. A couple of studies
reported mostly neutral effects of social media use on well-being
indicators <span class="citation">(Bradley and Howard 2021; Eden et al.

demonstrates a mixed picture, highlighting both positive and negative
effects of social media use focused on or during COVID-19 on
well-being.</p>
<!-- It is important to consider individual differences, usage patterns, and other factors that may influence the impact of social media on well-being during this challenging period. -->
<!-- ## Empirical Studies on Social Media Effects -->
<!-- There is still little empirical research on how well-being is affected by social media use that is focused on COVID-19 specifically. -->
<!-- Results are mixed. -->
<!-- When browsing social media for COVID-19 related news, many users reported being captivated to such an extent they could not stop using social media [@kleinDarklySoothingCompulsion2021]. -->
<!-- During the pandemic social media use was at an all-time high in the US [@statistaAverageDailyTime2021], for example to cope with the required physical distancing measures. -->
<!-- In a study with 1,131 residents from Wuhan in China, people who spent more time in quarantine also spent more time on social media [@yuePassiveSocialMedia2022].  -->
<!-- Those who spent more time on social media also engaged in more upward social comparison, which was related to increased levels of stress. -->
<!-- People who used social media as a primary source of information reported on average "significantly more unspecific anxiety and depression [...] and significantly more specific COVID-19 related anxiety symptoms" [@bendauAssociationsCOVID19Related2021, p. 288]. -->
<!-- @edenMediaCopingCOVID192020 analyzed how 425 US college students used media during the first wave of the pandemic, finding both positive and negative relations with well-being. -->
<!-- In a sample of 312 respondents collected via Amazon Mechanical Turk, people who used media to attain information were more lonely and less satisfied with their lives [@choiMediatedCommunicationMatters2021]. -->
<!-- In a large-scale study with 11,537 respondents from the US, increased COVID-19-related media consumption was related to more psychological distress [@stainbackCOVID1924News2020]. -->
<!-- A four-wave panel study with 384 young adults from the U.S. analyzed the effects of general digital technology use during the pandemic on mental health, finding that digital technology did not have significant effects on mental health [@sewallObjectivelyMeasuredDigital2021; for a similar study with comparable results, see @bradleyStressMoodSmartphone2021]. -->
<!-- A study with 2.057 respondents from Italy reported that during the pandemic virtual community and social connectedness increased [@guazziniSecondWaveAnalysis2022]. -->
<!-- In a study with 735 participants from Finland, levels of loneliness were stable during the pandemic, and people who engaged more on social media experienced less loneliness [@latikkaLonelinessPsychologicalDistress2022]. -->
<!-- Together, the literature is mixed, showing both positive and negative affects of social media use focused on or during COVID-19 on well-being [see also @dornemannHowGoodBad2021; @liuRelationOfficialWhatsAppdistributed2020; @riehmAssociationsMediaExposure2020]. -->
<p>In conclusion, given these mixed empirical results, together with the
observation that social media effects on well-being are very small in
general, and that several plausible theoretical mechanisms exist for
both positive and negative effects, I expect that COVID-19 related
communication on social media should not be decidedly positive or
negative. It seems most likely that both positive and negative coexist,
but that on average using social media for COVID-19 related reasons
should not have substantial effects on well-being.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hypothesis: The within-person effects of all measures of COVID-19
related social media use (types: reading, liking and sharing, posting;
channels: Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, YouTube, WhatsApp) on all
measures of well-being indicators (positive affect, negative affect,
life satisfaction)—while controlling for several stable and varying
covariates such as sociodemographic variables and psychological
dispositions (see below)—will be trivial.</p>
</blockquote>
<!-- Although the average effect of use on well-being is likely very small, it might be that specific subgroups exhibit larger effects. -->
<!-- > Research question: How do the effects of COVID-19 related social media use on well-being depend on gender, age, immigration background, education, and urban living context? -->
<!-- Because media effects can differ across users, situations, and content [@livingstoneEuropeanResearchChildren2018; @valkenburgDifferentialSusceptibilityMedia2013], I now briefly focus on the effects of COVID-19 related social media use specifically. -->
<!-- First, one could assume a _direct_ negative effect on well-being, and especially on positive or negative affect, which are more volatile and fluctuating. -->
<!-- Dangers, inequalities, corruption---these were the headlines during the pandemic across many countries worldwide. -->
<!-- If one learns about such events, the initial reaction might be shock, fear, or dismay. -->
<!-- Consuming such news can be depressing [@dornemannHowGoodBad2021], perhaps even changing some general perspectives on life. -->
<!-- <!-- So, just like being hit by a hammer hurts and we don't need any "mediating mechanism", this could be the case here as well. -->
<!-- That said, because not all news was negative, and because many people showed solidarity and compassion, there was also positive and uplifting content, potentially compensating for the negative effects [@dornemannHowGoodBad2021]. -->
<!-- A study with 2.057 respondents from Italy reported that during the pandemic virtual community and social connectedness even increased [@guazziniSecondWaveAnalysis2022]. -->
<!-- In a study with 735 participants from Finland, levels of loneliness did not decrease during the pandemic, and people who engaged more on social media experienced less loneliness [@latikkaLonelinessPsychologicalDistress2022]. -->
<!-- However, in light of a worldwide pandemic with millions of deaths, the negative direct effect seems more plausible. -->
<!-- Second, there could also be _indirect_ effects. -->
<!-- Although it is most likely that moderate social media use is not detrimental [@orbenTeenagersScreensSocial2020], overuse, however, might be more critical, and several studies have shown more pronounced negative effects for extreme users [@przybylskiLargescaleTestGoldilocks2017]. -->
<!-- To explain, overuse could impair well-being if it replaces meaningful or functional activities such as meeting others, working, actively relaxing, or exercising. -->
<!-- Another potentially negative mechanism at play are problematic social comparison processes.  -->
<!-- Therefore, if a society collectively overuses social media during a pandemic, there is potential for negative effects. -->
<!-- If overuse replaces such activities it's reasonable to assume that it's also detrimental. -->
<!-- On the other hand, one can make the case that using social media for COVID-19 related reasons might even be beneficial, especially in times of a pandemic. -->
<!-- Exchanging COVID-19 related messages with friends via WhatsApp might replace the in-person contact one would have otherwise, but which is literally impossible at the time. -->
<!-- In situations where meaningful and functional activities are prohibited, using social media to exchange about COVID-19 related topics might not be the worst idea. -->
<!-- Besides, given that nowadays a large number of experts, scientists, and politicians converse directly on social media, one can get first-hand high quality information on current developments. -->
<!-- <!-- On the other hand, there is of course also much disinformation, and "bingeing" on COVID-19 fake news might also pose risks for impaired well-being. -->
<!-- To summarize, it seems that from a theoretical perspective it is most likely that the average effects of social media use on well-being are negligible.  -->
<!-- Building on established theories from Communication and current empirical findings, we would not assume that effects are either profoundly negative or strongly positive. -->
<!-- However, note that all of these findings represent between-person relations stemming from cross-sectional data (see below). -->
<!-- We therefore don't know whether the differences in mental health and well-being are due to social media use or due to other third variables, such as age, health, employment, or education. -->
<!-- The question of whether and how social media use affects well-being _in general_, on the other hand, is well-researched. -->
<!-- This also holds true for the different types of communication such as active or passive use. -->
<!-- What determines whether or not an effect should be considered small or trivial? -->
<!-- As a starting point, we could refer to standardized effect sizes. -->
<!-- According to @cohenPowerPrimer1992, small effect sizes start at _r_ = .10. -->
<!-- Finally, several individual studies employing advanced methods found smalls relations between social media use and well-being [@orbenSocialMediaEnduring2019; @przybylskiDoesTakingShort2021a; @schemerImpactInternetSocial2021; @kerestesAdolescentsOnlineSocial2020]. -->
<!-- Although for roughly one quarter of all users the effects of social media use on well-being were negative, for almost the same number of users they were positive, while for the rest the effects were neutral [@beyensSocialMediaUse2021]. -->
<!-- This finding is aligned with the Differential Susceptibility to Media Effects Model:  -->
<!-- Although there is substantial _variation_ of media effects for individual users, the _average_ effects reported in the literature are often small [@valkenburgDifferentialSusceptibilityMedia2013].  -->
<!-- Together, the strongest argument to me is that _in general_ the effects of social media on well-being are, on average, small at best.  -->
<!-- Because this study only looks at _one part_ of social media use---namely, COVID-19 related interactions---it is very focused, diminishing the overall potential of the effects even further. -->
<!-- Whether or not using social media for COVID-19 related aspects is detrimental during a pandemic is also not entirely clear. -->
<!-- At least, there does not seem to be a case where we should expect a clear deviation to the negative, despite anecdotes of doomscrolling. -->
<!-- A meta review (i.e., an analysis of meta-analyses) found that the relation between social media use and well-being is likely in the negative spectrum but very small, potentially too small to matter [@meierComputermediatedCommunicationSocial2020a]. -->
<!-- And indeed, several if not most of the current meta-analyses find small to trivial effects [@huangTimeSpentSocial2017; @meierComputermediatedCommunicationSocial2020a; @fergusonThisMetaanalysisScreen2021]. -->
<!-- In this study, this general hypothesis will be analyzed specifically for the three communication types of (a) time spent reading, (b) liking and sharing, and (c) actively posting COVID-19 related content. -->
<!-- In addition, I will analyze how well-being is influenced by spending time on five prominent social media apps, including (a) Facebook, (b) Instagram, (c) Twitter, (d) WhatsApp, and (e) YouTube.  -->

<h2>Sample</h2>
<p>The data come from the Austrian Corona Panel Project <span

provided by the company Marketagent, Austria. Panel members were
incentivized with 180 credit points for each wave of the study. The
study was conducted between March 2020 and February 2023. Between March
2020 and July 2020, the intervals between waves were weekly, until May
2022 (wave 32) monthly, and afterward after 5 months. Each wave consists
of at least 1,500 respondents. Panel mortality was compensated through a

<h2>Smallest Effect Size of Interest</h2>
<!-- ## Inference Criteria -->
<p>Testing the hypothesis necessitates defining what is considered a
“trivial effect size”. <!-- Effectively testing this hypothesis  -->
<!-- Above I already referred to standardized effect sizes. -->
<!-- However, standardized effect sizes should only be a first step toward evaluating an effect's relevance [@baguleyStandardizedSimpleEffect2009]. -->
<!-- Standardized effect sizes are determined by a sample's variance,[^cohensd] which is problematic:  -->
<!-- The question of whether or not social media use affects a particular person in a relevant way should not depend on the variance in the sample in which that person's data were collected. -->
<!-- Instead, it should depend on absolute criteria. --> To this end, we
need to define a so-called smallest effect size of interest (SESOI)
<span class="citation">(Lakens, Scheel, and Isager 2018)</span>. A
trivial effect would then need to be smaller than the SESOI (see below).
What could be a minimally interesting, nontrivial effect? Being a
normative question, finding a clear, single, or unanimous answer is
impossible. <!-- In the end, it is a personal question. --> However, it
is still necessary and helpful to work toward a plausible benchmark. I
suggest the following SESOI for this research question:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>SESOI: If a heavy user of COVID-19 related social media news suddenly
<em>stops</em> using social media altogether, this should have a
<em>noticeable</em> impact on their overall well-being.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What does this mean practically and how can it be operationalized? In
this study, COVID-19 related social media use was measured on a 5-point
scale, ranging from 1 = <em>never</em> to 5 = <em>several times a
day</em>. Thus, a change of four units in social media use (e.g., a
complete stop) should correspond to a noticeable change in well-being.
What is a noticeable change in well-being? According to <span
class="citation">Norman, Sloan, and Wyrwich (2003)</span>, people can
reliably distinguish seven levels of satisfaction with health. So if
satisfaction is measured on a 7-point scale, a four unit change in
social media use should result in a one unit change in life
satisfaction.
<!-- Because the data were analyzed post-hoc, no a-priori sample size planning on the basis of power analyses was conducted. -->
<!-- The sample is large, and it is hence well-equipped to reliably detect small effects. -->
<!-- <!-- , which is why no exact post hoc power analysis were conducted. -->
<!-- In addition, because such large samples easily generate significant _p_-values even for very small effects, it helps that the hypotheses were tested with a smallest effect size of interest-approach. -->
<!-- To this end, I adopted the interval testing approach as proposed by @dienesUsingBayesGet2014. -->
<!-- On the basis of the SESOI, I defined a null region. -->
<!-- In what follows, I explain how I determined the SESOI and the null region. --></p>
<p>In this study, life satisfaction was measured on an 11-point scale.
If people can reliably differentiate 7 levels, this corresponds to 11 /
7 = 1.57 unit change on an 11-point scale. Hence, a four-point change in
media use (e.g., a complete stop) should result in a 1.57-point change
in life satisfaction. In a statistical regression analysis, <em>b</em>
estimates the change in the dependent variable if the independent
variable increases by one point. For life satisfaction, we would
therefore define a SESOI of <em>b</em> = 1.57 / 4 = 0.39. For positive
or negative affect, which was measured on a 5-point scale, our SESOI
would be <em>b</em> = 0.71 / 4 = 0.18. Because we are agnostic as to
whether the effects are positive or negative, the null region includes
both negative and positive effects. Finally, in order not to exaggerate
precision and to be less conservative, these numbers are reduced to
nearby thresholds.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> Together, this leads to a null region
ranging from <em>b</em> = -.30 to <em>b</em> = .30 for life
satisfaction, and <em>b</em> = -.15 to <em>b</em> = .15 for positive and
negative affect.</p>
<!-- As explained above, for well-being the null region was between _b_ = -.30 and _b_ = .30 (i.e., _b_ = |.30|). -->
<p>The hypothesis is analyzed using the interval testing approach as
proposed by <span class="citation">Dienes (2014)</span>. To illustrate,
let us consider the case of life satisfaction [SESOI: -.30 : +.30]. If
the 95% confidence interval falls completely within the null-region
(e.g., <em>b</em> = -.05, [95% CI: -.15, .05]), the hypothesis that the
effect is trivial is supported. If the confidence interval falls
completely outside of the null-region (e.g., <em>b</em> = -.40, [95% CI:
-.45, -.35]), the hypothesis is rejected and the existence of a
meaningful negative effect is supported. If the confidence interval and
the null region overlap (e.g., <em>b</em> = -.30, [95% CI: -.35, -.25]),
the hypothesis is not supported and the results are considered
inconclusive, while a meaningful positive effect is rejected. If the
confidence interval exceeds both sides of the null region (e.g.,
<em>b</em> = -.025, [95% CI: -.40, .35]), the hypothesis is not
supported and judgement is suspended. For an illustration, see Figure
@ref(fig:sesoi).</p>

<h2>Data Analysis</h2>
<div id="causality" class="section level3">
<h3>Causality</h3>
<!-- The hypothesis explicitly states a causal effect. -->
<!-- In non-experimental studies, longitudinal designs can help investigate causality. -->
<p>When using longitudinal designs to analyze causality, it is important
to (a) focus on within-person effects <span class="citation">(Hamaker
2014)</span>; to (b) control for confounders <span
class="citation">(Rohrer and Murayama 2021)</span>; and to (c) test a
plausible interval between measures <span class="citation">(Dormann and
Griffin 2015)</span>.
<!-- To illustrate, consider the following example. -->
<!-- Imagine that a person suddenly starts using social media much more than usual, and then after some time  becomes less satisfied with their life. -->
<!-- Eventually, use and life satisfaction return to prior levels. -->
<!-- If this happens to several people at the same time, in a longitudinal study we could then observe a significant effect of social media use on life satisfaction. -->
<!-- However, it could also be the case that during the study there was a major exogenous event (say, a pandemic), which caused large parts of the working population to loose their jobs. -->
<!-- Hence, the causal effect reported above was confounded, because in reality it was the pandemic that caused both social media use to rise and life satisfaction to go down. -->
<!-- Thus, only when controlling for _all_ relevant confounders, can we correctly estimate causality without bias [@rohrerThinkingClearlyCorrelations2018]. -->
<!-- Obviously, we can never be entirely sure to have included all confounders, which makes absolute statements regarding causality virtually impossible. -->
First, in non-experimental designs it makes much sense to analyze causal
effects from an internal, within-person perspective <span
class="citation">(Hamaker 2014)</span>. If a specific person changes
their media diet, we need to measure how this behavior affects their
well-being. Between-person comparisons from longitudinal data cannot
provide such insights <span class="citation">(Lucas 2022)</span>. To
test the hypothesis, I thus consider only the within-person effects.</p>
<p>Second, to identify confounders we should control for variables that
affect both media use and well-being, which helps isolate the actual
effect <span class="citation">(Rohrer 2018)</span>. Because we are
adopting a within-person perspective, we need to implement
<em>time-varying</em> confounders <span class="citation">(Rohrer and
Murayama 2021)</span>. And because we are determining the
<em>overall</em> causal effect, we need to make sure <em>not</em> to
control for mediating variables <span class="citation">(Rohrer
2018)</span>, for doing so would bias our assessment of the causal
effect.
<!-- Complicating matters further, it is often unclear if a variable is a mediator or a confounder.[^collider] -->
<!-- However, despite all these caveats, when controlling for relevant variables (that aren't mediators), we can be much more certain that we measured causality correctly. -->
<!-- The aim should therefore be to collect as many varying and non-varying confounders as possible (which I believe is seldom done in our field), while knowing that absolute certainty regarding causality cannot be reached. -->
<!-- [^collider]: In addition, there also exist colliders, which I don't discuss here and which complicate the issue even further [@rohrerThinkingClearlyCorrelations2018]. -->
<!-- We can also control for variables that affect only social media use or well-being.  -->
<!-- However, in doing so not much is gained, because the effects of social media use would remain virtually the same [@klinePrinciplesPracticeStructural2016; but see @mcelreathYesterdayClass2021]. -->
In this study, I hence preregistered to control for the following
variables, which either have already been shown or are likely to affect
both social media use and well-being, and which also are not mediators:
<!-- (I'll additionally include variables that likely affect only well-being, also to obtain a comparison benchmark for social media effects): -->
gender, age, education, Austria country of birth, Austria country of
birth of parents, residency Vienna, text-based news consumption,
video-based news consumption, household size, health, living space,
access to garden, access to balcony, employment, work hours per week,
being in home-office, household income, outdoor activities, disposition
to take risks, and locus of control <span class="citation">(Eger and
Maridal 2015; Ward et al. 2016)</span>. <!-- [^explore] -->
<!-- I will not control for variables such as trust in institutions or trust in media, because these variables might be influenced by social media use to a meaningful extent. --></p>
<!-- [^explore]: The data-set includes many other variables that one could also potentially control for, and I invite interested readers to download the and explore potential interesting relationships. -->
<!-- Next to including covariates, it is now increasingly understood that  -->
<p>Finally, one precondition of causality is temporal order and finding
a plausible interval <span class="citation">(Dormann and Griffin
2015)</span>. <!-- The cause needs to precede the effect. -->
<!-- Finding the right interval between cause and effect is crucial. -->
<!-- For example, if we want to understand the effect of alcohol consumption on driving performance, it makes a big difference if driving performance is measured one minute, one hour, one day, or one week after consumption. -->
<!-- Finding the right interval is difficult. --> If variables are
stable, longer intervals are needed; if they fluctuate, shorter
intervals. In the case of well-being, we need shorter intervals for the
more fluctuating positive and negative affect, and longer ones for the
more stable life satisfaction <span class="citation">(Dienlin and
Johannes 2020)</span>. Whereas using social media can have instant
effects on mood <span class="citation">(Marciano et al. 2022)</span>,
effects on life satisfaction often take longer to manifest. For example,
because media use leads to actual changes in specific behaviors, which
then in turn affect life satisfaction <span class="citation">(Dienlin,
Masur, and Trepte 2017)</span>.
<!-- Choosing the right interval is challenging, because especially short intervals are hard to implement in practice, often requiring advanced methods such as experience sampling (also known as in situ measurement or ambulant assessment) [@schnauber-stockmannMobileDevicesTools2020]. --></p>
<p>In this study, I hence analyze how changes in using social media
<em>during the last week</em> affected changes in positive and negative
affect <em>during the same week</em>. In other words, if people during
the last week engaged in more COVID-19 related social media use than
usual, did they feel better or worse during that week than usual? For
life satisfaction, I implemented a longer interval. If people <em>during
the last week</em> used COVID-19 related social media more than they
usually do, were they <em>at the end of the week</em> more or less
satisfied with their lives than they usually are? This way it is
analyzed if when a person changes their social media diet, are there (a)
<em>simultaneous</em> changes in their affect and (b)
<em>subsequent</em> changes in their life satisfaction? For the main
analyses, the interval is implemented via the wording of the items (see
below), not by using lagged measures coming from prior waves waves. In
additional analyses, I also tested how media use affects well-being one
month or four months later.
<!-- This significantly increases sample size, such that all respondents who answered the media measures at least two times can be implemented. -->
All analyses will be controlled for varying confounders (see below),
which fosters a causal interpretation.

<h3>Statistical model</h3>
<p>The hypothesis was analyzed using random effect within-between models
<span class="citation">(REWB, Bell, Fairbrother, and Jones 2019)</span>.
Altogether three models were run, one for each dependent variable. The
data were hierarchical, and responses were separately nested in
participants and waves (i.e., participants and waves were implemented as
random effects). Nesting in participants accounts for the longitudinal
design. Nesting in waves controls for general exogenous developments,
such as general decreases in well-being in the population, for example
due to lockdown measures. Thus, there was no need additionally to
control for specific phases or measures of the lockdown. Predictors were
modeled as fixed effects. They included social media communication types
and channels, separated into within and between-person factors, as well
as stable and varying covariates. Between-person predictors are the
predictors centered on the grand mean; within-person predictors are the
predictors centered on the person’s mean. Between-person predictors
(which, measuring relations, are not of particular interest in this
study) represent how the mean of one respondent differs from the mean of
all the other respondents. The within-person predictors represent how
much a person at one specific wave differs from their own mean. For
example, we could find that on Wave 3 a person used social media more
than usual, while also experiencing more negative affect than usual. All
predictors were included simultaneously in each of the three models.</p>
<p>The factorial validity of the scales were tested with confirmatory
factor analyses (CFA). Because Mardia’s test showed that the assumption
of multivariate normality was violated, I used the more robust
Satorra-Bentler scaled and mean-adjusted test statistic (MLM) as
estimator.
<!-- To avoid over-fitting, I tested the scales on more liberal fit criteria (CFI > .90, TLI > .90, RMSEA <. .10, SRMR < .10) [@klinePrinciplesPracticeStructural2016]. -->
<!-- Finally, REWB-models cannot model latent variables. -->
<!-- To increase precision, I therefore exported factor scores from the CFAs for positive and negative affect. -->
Mean scores were used for positive and negative affect.
<!-- Respondents who answered less than 50% of all questions were removed. -->
Missing responses were imputed using multiple imputation with predictive
mean matching (five iterations, 30 data-sets), including categorical
variables. All variables were imputed except the social media use
measures, as they were not collected on each wave. All variables
included in the analyses presented here were used to impute missing
data. For the main analyses, results were pooled across all thirty
data-sets.</p>
<p>To contextualize the results, I conducted additional exploratory
analyses. I reran the analyses (a) with additional not-preregistered
covariates such as trust in media or government, (b) without covariates,
(c) with single imputation, and (d) without imputation. For more
information on the analyses, a complete documentation of the models and
results, and all additional analyses, see <a

<!-- The additional analyses are reported on the [companion website](https://XMtRA.github.io/Austrian_Corona_Panel_Project/analyses_additional.html). -->
<!-- For example, all within-person standardized COVID-19 related types of social media use or channels were significantly smaller than $\beta$ = |.05|, again supporting that effects were negligible. --></p>

<h3>COVID-19 related social media use</h3>
<p>COVID-19 related social media use focused on communication types was
measured with the three dimensions of (a) reading, (b) liking and
sharing, and (c) posting. The items come from <span
class="citation">Wagner et al. (2018)</span> and were adapted for the
context of this study. The general introductory question was “How often
during the last week have you engaged in the following activities on
social media?”. The three items were “Reading the posts of others with
content on the Coronavirus”, “When seeing posts on the Coronavirus, I
clicked ‘like’, ‘share’ or ‘retweet’”, “I myself wrote posts on the
Coronavirus on social media.” Answer options were 1 (<em>several times
per day</em>), 2 (<em>daily</em>), 3 (<em>several times per week</em>),
4 (<em>weekly</em>), 5 (<em>never</em>). The items were inverted for the
analyses.</p>
<p>COVID-19 related social media use focused on channels was measured
with five variables from <span class="citation">Wagner et al.
(2018)</span>, adapted for this study. The general introductory question
was “How often in the last week have you followed information related to
the Corona-crisis on the following social media?” The five items were
(a) Facebook, (b) Twitter, (c) Instagram, (d) Youtube, and (e) WhatsApp.
Again, the answer options were 1 (<em>several times per day</em>), 2
(<em>daily</em>), 3 (<em>several times per week</em>), 4
(<em>weekly</em>), 5 (<em>never</em>). Again, the items were inverted
for the analyses.</p>
<p>Social media use was measured for all participants on waves 1, 2, 8,
17, 23, and 28 (see Figure 1). Freshly recruited respondents always
answered all questions on COVID 19-related social media use. Because new
respondents always provided data on media use, it was possible to
include these data into the analyses. Hence, for the main analyses data
from all 34 waves were used. In the additional analyses I tested longer
intervals, namely if changes in social media use were associated with
changes in well-being either one month of four months later. For these
analyzes I used the predictors from waves 1, 2, 8, 17, 23, and 28, to
see if they predicted changes in well-being either one month or four
months later.</p>

<h3>Control variables</h3>
<p>The effects of COVID-19 related social media use were controlled for
the following stable variables: gender (female, male, diverse), age,
education (ten options), Austria country of birth (yes/no), Austria
parents’ country of birth (no parent, one parent, both parents), and
household size.
<!-- I originally planned to implement additional variables as varying covariates. -->
I also controlled for the following varying covariates: five items on
current living conditions, including self-reported physical health,
whether participants contracted COVID-19 since the last wave, current
household income, working in home-office, and overall work hours; nine
items measuring use of specific national text-based and video-based news
outlets; five items measuring outdoor activities such as exercise or
meeting friends; and two more psychological measures including locus of

<div id="descriptive-analyses" class="section level2">
<h2>Descriptive Analyses</h2>
<p>Looking at the variables from a descriptive perspective, aligned with
set-point theory we can see that the level of all well-being measures
were surprisingly stable during data collection (see Figure
@ref(fig:fig-descriptives)). COVID-19 related social media use, however,
showed changes. Reading, sharing and liking COVID-19 related content
decreased substantially (almost one scale point from 3 to 2). Posting
about COVID-19 related content stayed the same. Using Facebook and
WhatsApp for COVID-19 related content decreased. Instagram, YouTube, and
Twitter stayed the same. The general initial decrease could be explained
by the fact that the collection of data began at the end of March 2020,
hence approximately three months after the pandemic’s onset. After an
initial uptick, COVID-19 related social media use might have already
been declining at the time.</p>

</p>
</div>
<p>Using the average values across all waves, which provides a stable
picture of the general relations, I next looked at the correlations
between social media use and well-being (see Figure
@ref(fig:fig-correlations)). Several interesting patterns emerged. In
general, people who spend more time engaging with COVID-19 related
content on social media reported reduced well-being. Users who spend
more time reading, liking and sharing, and posting COVID-19 related
content were less satisfied with their lives. They also showed slightly
less positive affect. This overall negative picture was even more
pronounced for negative affect. People who engaged more with COVID-19
related content, including all types and channels of communication,
reported substantially higher levels of negative affect. For example,
people who were more likely to post COVID-19 content had much higher
levels of negative affect (<em>r</em> = .61). Note that these results
represent between-person correlations, not causal within-person
effects.</p>

<h2>Preregistered Analyses</h2>
<div id="social-media-communication-types" class="section level3">
<h3>Social media communication types</h3>
<p>The study’s main hypothesis was that the causal effects of all types
and channels of social media use on all facets of well-being would be
trivial. Regarding the effects of different communication types (i.e.,
reading, sharing, of posting about COVID-19 related content), all
within-person effects fell completely within the a-priori defined null
region (see Figure @ref(fig:fig-within)). For example, respondents who
used social media more frequently than usual to like or share COVID-19
related content did not show a simultaneous change in life satisfaction
(<em>b</em> = -0.02 [95% CI -0.06, 0.01]). As a result, the hypothesis
of trivial effects was supported for all COVID-19 related types of
social media communication.</p>
<p>However, several effects stood out, as statistically they were
significantly different from zero. Users who read more COVID-19 related
content than usual reported slightly reduced levels of positive affect
(<em>b</em> = -0.03 [95% CI -0.05, -0.02]). Users who liked and shared
more COVID-19 related content than usual also experienced slightly more
negative affect than usual (<em>b</em> = 0.05 [95% CI 0.04, 0.07]).
Posting COVID-19 related content affected all types of well-being. Users
who wrote more COVID-19 related posts than usual also reported slightly
less life satisfaction than usual (<em>b</em> = -0.04 [95% CI -0.08,
-0.01]) and slightly more negative affect than usual (<em>b</em> = 0.05
[95% CI 0.04, 0.07]). Interestingly, however, users who wrote more
COVID-19 related posts than usual also experienced slightly
<em>higher</em> levels of positive affect than usual (<em>b</em> = 0.02
[95% CI 0.01, 0.04]).</p>
</div>
<div id="social-media-communication-channels" class="section level3">
<h3>Social media communication channels</h3>
<p>Regarding the COVID-19 related use of social media channels (i.e.,
Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, YouTube, and Twitter) the results were
comparable (see Figure @ref(fig:fig-within)). Changes in the frequency
of using different social media channels to attain information regarding
COVID-19 were unrelated to meaningful changes in well-being. For
example, respondents who used Facebook more frequently than usual to
learn about COVID-19 did not show a simultaneous change in life
satisfaction (<em>b</em> -0.01 [95% CI -0.04, 0.02]). In sum, the
hypothesis of trivial effects was supported also for the COVID-19
related use of important social media channels.</p>
<p>That said, two effects differed statistically from zero. Respondents
who used Twitter more frequently than usual to attain COVID-19 related
news reported slightly higher levels of negative affect than usual
(<em>b</em> = 0.02 [95% CI 0.01, 0.04]). Likewise, respondents who used
YouTube more frequently than usual for COVID-19 related issues reported
slightly higher levels of negative affect than usual (<em>b</em> = 0.01
[95% CI &lt; 0.01, 0.02]). However, both effects were still completely
inside of the null region, hence likely not large enough to be
considered meaningful.</p>

<h2>Exploratory Analyses</h2>
<!-- In what follows, I briefly report some exploratory analyses that weren't preregistered. -->
<p>To contextualize the results reported above and to see if the study
included any meaningful effects at all, I also looked at the effect
sizes of the covariates. Because each variable featured different
response options, which would require defining a SESOI for each
variable, I hence report the results of the standardized scales, which
allows for a better comparison across the differently scaled variables.
Here, we can build on Cohen’s convention that small effects begin at
<em>r</em> = |.10|.</p>
<p>The results showed that several effects crossed or fell completely
outside of the SESOI, and can hence be considered meaningful. For
example, if physical health decreased, this had a meaningful detrimental
impact on life satisfaction (<span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span>
= .19 [95% CI .18, .20]), positive affect (<span
class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> = .18 [95% CI .17, .19]), and
negative affect (<span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> = -.19 [95%
CI -.20, -.18]). Spending more time outside to exercise meaningfully
increased positive affect (<span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> =
.12 [95% CI .11, .14]).
<!-- Being more satisfied with the current democratic system meaningfully increased life satisfaction ($\beta$  [95% CI , ]). -->
The strongest aspect affecting well-being was internal locus of control.
If people felt more in control of their lives, this strongly increased
both life satisfaction (<span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> = .33
[95% CI .31, .35]) and positive affect (<span
class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> = .28 [95% CI .27, .30]), while
decreasing negative affect (<span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> =
-.29 [95% CI -.31, -.27]). For an overview, see Figure

<p>Because life satisfaction is more stable than affect, the effects of
communication might materialize some time later. I hence also tested the
effects across the longer intervals of one month and four months.
Results showed that all effects disappeared. No effect remained
significant, implying that at least in this case in this case effects
take place on a shorter interval.</p>
<p>Finally, as suggested by the differential susceptibility of media
effects model, media effects can depend on dispositional factors,
developmental stages, or cultural norms <span class="citation">(Patti M.
Valkenburg and Peter 2013)</span>, such as gender and age <span
class="citation">(Orben et al. 2022)</span>. I hence reran the analyses,
differentiating effects for boys and girls and for age cohorts. The
results showed that effects did not differ across genders. The effects
also did not depend on age. However, one effect stood out and was
significant. Compared to the middle age category Generation X, results
showed that if users from Generation Z posted more COVID-19 content than
usual this lead to significantly more negative affect (<span
class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> = .04 [95% CI .01, .06]).

<h1>Discussion</h1>
<p>Based on a panel study with 34 waves largely representative of the
Austrian population, this study analyzed the effects of COVID-19 related
social media use on well-being. Between person correlation analyses
showed that more active users of COVID-19 related content on social
media also reported decreased well-being. For example, respondents who
read more COVID-19 related content than others reported slightly lower
levels of life satisfaction, somewhat lower levels of positive affect,
and substantially higher levels of negative affect than others. To see
if these between person correlations would translate to within-person
effects, I analyzed if changes in a person’s media use led to changes in
their well-being. The within-person relations showed a different
pattern. If people consumed more COVID-19 content on social media than
usual, this did not meaningfully reduce their well-being. Although
several statistically significant effects were found, these were very
small. For example, people who read more COVID-19 related posts than
usual reported slightly decreased positive affect. People who liked and
shared more COVID-19 related posts than usual reported slightly higher
levels of negative affect. Posting more content about COVID-19 than
usual slightly decreased life satisfaction, while increasing both
negative affect and positive affect. Using Twitter for COVID-19 related
content slightly increased negative affect, as did YouTube.
<!-- was related to Reading COVID-19 related content on social media slightly reduced positive affect. -->
Again, although all of these within-person effects were statistically
significant, they were very small, smaller than the predefined smallest
effect size of interest. According to the preregistered procedure, they
should hence be considered irrelevant. Additional analyses revealed that
other factors, for which we would expect to find meaningful effects,
such as health or sports, indeed showed substantial and meaningful
impacts on well-being. In addition, when testing for the longer
intervals of one month and four months, again no meaningful effects were
found. In conclusion, COVID-19 related activity on social media was not
a particularly strong influence on peoples’ well-being. The results do
not support the popular fears that “doomscrolling” or overusing social
media during times of crises constitutes a prominent risk for
well-being.</p>
<!-- People who used social media more than usual to learn about COVID-19 didn't show meaningful changes in their well-being. -->
<!-- The results imply that COVID-19 related social media use doesn't seem to be particularly relevant for well-being. -->
<!-- Other factors among the third variables that were measured revealed larger effects or relations, suggesting that well-being is rather determined by alternative aspects such as health, satisfaction with democracy, locus of control, or exercising. -->
<p>These specific observations notwithstanding, several general trends
can be observed. First, overall the results do suggest that effects of
COVID-19 related social media use on well-being tend to take place in
the negative as opposed to the positive spectrum. Although very small,
five statistically significant negative results of COVID-19 related
social media use on well-being were found. Only one positive effect
emerged. Also note that in the analyses several control variables were
included, ruling out plausible alternative explanations for the negative
results. For example, it was controlled for as to whether or not
participants contracted a COVID-19 infection during a specific wave.
Hence, we can rule out the alternative explanation that having an
infection was the root cause of increased communication and reduced
well-being.</p>
<p>Second, six significant outcomes emerged for positive or negative
affect, but only one for life satisfaction. Life satisfaction is more
stable and not that easily affected by any type or channel of social
media communication. The more fluctuating positive and negative affect,
however, were affected (albeit only slightly). Liking, sharing, and
posting COVID-19 related content, and spending more time on Twitter and
YouTube to browse COVID-19 related content, all slightly negatively
influenced affect. This is aligned with prior findings which showed that
social media use can trigger negative affect, but that it is less likely
to determine life satisfaction <span class="citation">(Huang
2017)</span>.
<!-- Writing posts implies more substantial engagement, and perhaps also negative exchanges with other users, which could explain the results. -->
<!-- For example, people who wrote more COVID-19 related posts than usual reported slightly lower levels of life satisfaction than usual. -->
<!-- Similarly, people who wrote more COVID-19 related posts than usual also reported slightly more negative affect. -->
<!-- As a potential explanation, when writing posts and comments on social media people explicitly and more deeply engage with COVID-19 related content. -->
Conversations about COVID-19 on social media are often extreme,
negative, or aggressive <span class="citation">(L. Fan, Yu, and Yin
2020)</span>. More deeply engaging with this type of content could
negatively affect active authors. The hypothesis that tonality could
explain the negative effects is especially supported by the observation
that spending more time on Twitter and YouTube than usual increased
negative affect. Communication on both channels is often found to be
negative and impolite <span class="citation">(e.g., Mueller and Saeltzer
2022)</span>, also when compared to other SNSs <span
class="citation">(Halpern and Gibbs 2013)</span>. Consuming more
negative and misleading information could hence explain the (slightly)
increased levels of negative affect.</p>
<p>Third, the results show that it makes sense to analyze different
communication types and communication channels. Reading slightly reduced
positive affect, while liking, sharing, and posting slightly increased
negative affect. Interestingly, posting COVID-19 related comment
slightly increased negative affect, while at the same time it also
slightly increased positive affect. Posting content is often met with
strong reaction, both positive by means of likes and negative by means
of critical comments. Overall, though, posting led to slightly reduced
levels of life satisfaction. In conclusion, whereas it was often stated
that passive use is bad and active use good <span
class="citation">(Verduyn et al. 2015)</span>, this pattern was only
partially found here. <!-- Instead, all three types were negative. -->
The results are aligned with the findings from <span
class="citation">Patti M. Valkenburg, van Driel, and Beyens
(2022)</span>, who could not confirm that active use is good and that
passive use is bad. Focusing on communication channels, Twitter and
YouTube seem to be more negative, as has often been observed <span
class="citation">(Halpern and Gibbs 2013)</span>, while Instagram,
WhatsApp, and Facebook were neutral. But, again, all of these effects
are very small. Future research might elaborate on these specific
relations to probe their stability and relevance.</p>
<p>Taken together, the results are hence aligned with the underlying
theoretical models and prior empirical results. The findings support the
differential susceptibility of media effects model <span
class="citation">(Patti M. Valkenburg and Peter 2013)</span>, such that
effects are generally small and that they depend on the type and channel
of communication. Additional analyses did not reveal that effects
depended on gender. Age also large did not play a significant moderation
role, but effects of posting COVID-19 related content were found to be
more negative for Generation Z. Indeed, it has often been argued that
effects of social media use are more negative for Gen Z than for prior
generations, and this finding can be seen a further tentative support
for this hypothesis. From a broader perspective, the results are
well-aligned with mood management theory <span
class="citation">(Zillmann 1988)</span> and the uses and gratifications
approach <span class="citation">(Katz, Blumler, and Gurevitch
1973)</span>, whose premises preclude particularly negative effects of
routine and widespread media consumption. Both theories posit that if
the effects of social media were indeed profoundly negative on average,
then people likely would not spend so much time on social media engaging
with COVID-19 content. Finally, recent empirical studies and
meta-analyses reported rather small negative effects, too. Several
studies found that the effects of various types of social media use on
well-being are small, often too small to matter <span
class="citation">(Bendau et al. 2021; Meier and Reinecke 2020; Orben
2020; Ferguson et al. 2021)</span>, echoing the results obtained
here.</p>
<!-- The results allow us to reject a positive effect: Writing more posts on social media will likely not increase well-being. -->
<!-- First, in terms of media channels, using Twitter more than usual was related to slightly decreased levels of life satisfaction. -->
<!-- Twitter is considered to have more negative affordances and tonality as compared to other networks such as Instagram [@waterlooNormsOnlineExpressions2018], which might help explain the results. -->
<!-- Second, of all the three COVID-19 related social media activities, people who read about the pandemic more than others showed slightly decreased levels of positive affect, and people who actively posted about the pandemic more than others showed slightly increased levels of negative affect. -->
<!-- On the other hand, however, people who posted more about COVID-19 also showed slightly higher levels of positive affects, so taken together the results are ambivalent. -->
<!-- Finally, another interesting observation is that life satisfaction was remarkably stable. -->
<!-- Hence, even in times of a pandemic, it seems that such broad assessment of life vary only mildly. -->
<!-- This supports the hypothesis that life satisfaction seems to be determined largely by stable factors such as one's genes [@brownEasyHappinessPie2019]. -->
<div id="limitations" class="section level2">
<h2>Limitations</h2>
<!-- The current study analyzed whether changes in media use were related to changes in well-being. -->
<p>Focusing on within-person effects and controlling for several
potential confounders, this study provides an improved perspective on
assessing causality. However, several challenges remain.
<!-- First, it could be that the timing of the interval was wrong; it could be that effects unfold in shorter or longer intervals.  -->
<!-- Next, it could be that there was not sufficient variance in media use and well-being.  -->
<!-- Without sufficient variability, statistical models cannot detect existing effects. -->
<!-- Third,  --> In order to correctly establish causality in
non-experimental designs, it is necessary to control for <em>all</em>
relevant confounding third variables <span class="citation">(Rohrer
2018)</span>. Although this study included are large list of
confounders, it could still be that crucial variables were missed.
<!-- [@zillmannMoodManagementCommunication1988]. -->
<!-- While controlling for potential confounders can support claims of causality, the procedure implemented here cannot prove causality. -->
<!-- Causality necessitates temporal order, and the cause needs to precede the effect. -->
<!-- The challenge is that regarding media use, such effects often happen immediately or shortly after use, necessitating intervals in the hours, minutes, or even seconds. -->
<!-- In many cases only experience sampling studies asking users at the very moment can produce such knowledge. -->
<!-- However, even then we don't know for certain if we actually measured the right interval. -->
<!-- Effects depend on the intensity of use or the length of the interval. -->
<!-- To borrow the words from @rohrerTheseAreNot2021, there is no such thing as "the" effect of social media use on well-being. -->
<!-- The results reported here are hence contingent on the design I used. -->
<!-- To document how effects unfold, future research needs to employ different study designs probing different intervals. -->
More thought needs to be invested in which factors to control for and,
equally important, for which factors not to control for. I hope this
study provides a first step into this direction.</p>
<p>Although I had already reduced the predefined SESOIs to be less
conservative, one could argue they were still too large. Media use is
only one aspect of several factors that simultaneously affect
well-being. Is it realistic to expect that changing only <em>one</em> of
these aspects should already manifest in a detectable change in
well-being? Or would it make more sense to expect that thoroughly
committing to say <em>two</em> activities (e.g. regularly exercising
<em>and</em> establishing a reading habit) should then cause a
detectable improvement in well-being? Practically, this would imply a
SESOI half the size defined here, namely <em>b</em> = |.15| for life
satisfaction and <em>b</em> = |.075| for affect. In the case of this
study, however, even halving the SESOI would not make a difference. All
but one effect would still be completely in the null region, and no
effect would fall completely outside of the null region. I encourage
future research to elaborate on what effect sizes are considered
meaningful and what not.
<!-- Again, with this study I hope to provide some first input and guidelines. --></p>
<p>Both media use and well-being were measured using self-reports.
Because assessing well-being necessarily requires introspection, using
self-reports for affect and life satisfaction is adequate. However, for
social media use objective measures are clearly preferable, as people
often cannot reliably estimate their use <span
class="citation">(Scharkow 2016)</span>. At the same time, most
objective measures cannot capture the content or the motivation of use.
Hence, for the type of research question analyzed here, it still seems
necessary to use self-reported measures. In many cases they can still be
informative <span class="citation">(Verbeij et al. 2021)</span>.</p>
<p>Being collected in a single country, the generalizability of the
results is limited. The results apply primarily to the more Western
sphere. They might not hold true in other cultures, especially cultures
with a different media landscape or alternative social media channels.
<!-- That said, being a comparatively large study largely representative of one country, with several waves collected across a large time span, the results should be at least as generalizable as other typical empirical studies collected in the social sciences. -->
<!-- Social media use was measured with an ordinal variable, however in the analyses it was treated as a numerical one. -->
<!-- If treated as an ordinal one, it would have been necessary to analyze four different contrasts for each media measure, which plus the differentiation between between and within factor would have produced eight different measures, we would have made the model exceedingly complex. --></p>
</div>
<div id="conclusion" class="section level2">
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<!-- That said, the results still imply that it does make sense to critically reflect upon COVID-19 related social media use.  -->
<!-- On average, it seems more beneficial to post less actively about COVID-19 on social media and to spend less time on Twitter and YouTube consuming COVID-19 related content. -->
<p>In this study, COVID-19 related social media use did not meaningfully
affect well-being. Very small negative effects were found for writing
COVID-19 related posts, sharing COVID-19 related content, and spending
more time than usual on Twitter. Factors other than social media use,
however, were meaningfully related to well-being, including physical
health, exercise, satisfaction with democracy, or believing that one is
in control of one’s life. In light of the overall very small effects,
engaging in COVID 19-related social media use should not be considered a
major concern for one’s well-being. Hence, when trying to improve
well-being during a pandemic, instead of focusing on social media it
seems more fruitful to address other, more pertinent societal problems
related to health care, regular exercise, or psychological
resilience.</p>

The black estimates show the effects controlled for a large number of covariates (see text; preregistered); the grey estimates are without control variables (exploratory). The SESOI was b = |0.30| for life satisfaction and b = |0.15| for affect. Hence, all of the reported effects are not considered meaningful.}\label{fig:res-activity}

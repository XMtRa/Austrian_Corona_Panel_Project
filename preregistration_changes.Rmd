## Covariates

When reading the documentation of the data, I thought the following variables were varying, when in fact they were assessed only at one wave, namely the first wave:

- Analyses
	- Missingness
		- Impute missing values

		- Replace values where I know they're 0
	- Add factor scores
	- CFA
		- Add results
